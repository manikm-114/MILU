1,"Hi everyone, and welcome to this online course on Medical Imaging. I’m Professor Ge Wang, and I’ll be guiding you through this exciting journey.

Medical imaging is a fascinating and powerful field. It brings together science, engineering, and medicine to help us see what’s happening inside the human body—without making a single cut. Whether your background is in engineering, physics, computer science, or biology, you’ll find that medical imaging offers something valuable and fascinating.

In the weeks ahead, we’ll build a strong foundation in the core principles of imaging and describe a variety of technologies that are transforming modern healthcare. I'm excited to get started—and I hope you are too.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

2,"We’ll begin with the fundamentals — systems, Fourier analysis, signal processing — and hands-on MATLAB sessions. Then we’ll explore major imaging techniques: X-ray and radiography, CT, PET, SPECT, MRI, ultrasound, optical, and deep imaging. Along the way, we’ll have three exams to help you review and reinforce what you learn


Now, just a quick note: in a traditional classroom, I’d mention office hours; however, since this is an online course, I encourage you to participate actively in our discussion forums. Don’t hesitate to post questions or thoughts as they come up. Learning is always more effective when it's interactive.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

3,"So, to kick things off, let me give you a quick overview of what we’ll cover today.

There are four main questions we’ll explore:

First, what is medical imaging?

Second, why should we study it?

Third, who are involved in this course?

And finally, how are we going to approach the material?

Now, when we talk about medical imaging—sometimes we use the terms biomedical imaging or bio-instrumentation—we’re referring to a wide range of methods, technologies and systems that help us see inside the human body, animals, or biological samples. These methods are grounded in engineering, physics, and biomedicine.

And this isn’t just about theory. You’ll also get hands-on experience with tools like MATLAB, and you’ll work with selected reading materials and online resources. By the end of the course, you’ll not only understand how these imaging systems work but also be able to apply that knowledge in a meaningful way.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

4,"Let’s continue explaining our idea of medical imaging as a form of inner vision.

You know, as humans, our natural vision is powerful—but it’s limited. We can see the world around us, we can observe surfaces, recognize faces, navigate through our environment. But our vision is tied to visible light, and that means we can’t see through most objects. We don’t know what’s behind a wall, inside a box, or within our own bodies.

That’s where medical imaging comes in. It gives us the ability to look beyond the surface—to see inside the human body without making a single incision. This is what makes medical imaging so extraordinary. It extends our natural vision, allowing us to explore what’s hidden, to understand both the structure and function of our organs, and to help guide medical care.

Think about it—when someone doesn’t feel well, when there’s discomfort or concern, what do we do? We turn to imaging. It becomes the eyes of the physician, revealing what’s happening beneath the surface. Through imaging, doctors can measure physiological function, detect disease, and ultimately provide treatment that can ease suffering or even save lives.

That’s the true power of medical imaging—and why we call it the inner vision of modern medicine.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

5,"Let me ask you this—what if we could see through the human body, almost like having X-ray vision? Imagine being able to look at tissues, organs, even down to the cellular level. Sounds like science fiction, right?

Well, that’s exactly the dream of medical imaging. This field gives us a kind of ""super vision""—an inner vision—that lets us explore the human body from the inside out, completely noninvasively.

And the truth is, what once seemed futuristic is now part of everyday medical practice. With the tools we’ll talk about in this course, clinicians can detect problems earlier, treat patients more precisely, and monitor progress more closely. Many of the advances in imaging came from the needs that once seemed impossible—until technology caught up. You’ll see how these breakthroughs happened, and why they matter.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

6,"Now, let’s go back to where it all began. In 1895, a German physicist named Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen was experimenting with cathode rays when he discovered something totally unexpected—an invisible form of radiation that could pass through solid objects. He called them X-rays because he didn’t quite know what they were.

To test his discovery, he took the first X-ray image—a picture of his wife’s hand. You could clearly see the bones, and even her wedding ring. It was the first time humans saw inside the body without surgery. That moment changed medicine forever.

X-rays could depict dense structures like bones and metal with incredible clarity. This breakthrough was so significant that Roentgen received a Nobel Prize in 1901.

That single discovery launched the field of radiology—and over a century later, we’re still building on it.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
7,"Fast forward to today, and X-ray imaging—specifically X-ray radiography—is one of the most common tools used in hospitals and clinics around the world. It’s fast, affordable, and incredibly useful.

Let’s say someone falls and hurts their arm. An X-ray can quickly show whether there's a fracture. Or in breast cancer screening, mammography—a specialized type of X-ray radiography—can reveal tiny calcifications or early tumors that might not be detectable by touch. Early detection like this can save lives.

But there’s a limitation with X-ray radiographs. They’re 2D projections, so everything in the body along the X-ray path gets stacked into one image. That makes it hard to see soft tissues clearly or to isolate specific structures.

So, the next logical step was to ask—what if we could look from multiple directions and reconstruct a full 3D view of what’s inside? That question led to the development of Computed Tomography, or CT, which we’ll get into next.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
8,"Alright, so earlier we talked about how regular X-rays give us a flat, two-dimensional view of the body. But there’s a catch—everything in that path gets layered on top of each other. It’s like looking at shadows overlapped together.

Now imagine if we could take many X-ray radiographs around the body—virtually, of course—and figure out what’s happening on transverse sections. That’s exactly what computed tomography, or CT, allows us to do.

The word ""tomography"" comes from Greek—""tomos"" means slice, and ""graphy"" means writing or drawing. So, we're basically drawing slices of the body. With CT, we collect X-ray projections from many angles, then use a computer to reconstruct a cross-sectional image.

The result? A crystal-clear view of internal anatomy, without overlapping tissues. Today’s CT scanners are incredibly precise—some can even resolve features smaller than a millimeter. Think of it like slicing a watermelon and looking inside but doing it without a knife—just scanning. It’s an amazing tool, and one that has completely transformed modern medicine.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

9,"Now, if you want to get a fun and visual explanation of how X-rays work, there’s a great animated video I did for TED-Ed. It’s called “How X-rays See Through Your Skin.”

In just a few minutes, it walks you through how X-rays are produced, how they interact with the body, and how detected signals are turned into a cross-sectional image. It’s a great refresher, especially if you’re a visual learner.

You’ll also see how this technology became the foundation for other types of imaging we’ll cover—like PET, SPECT, and MRI. The video’s optional, but I really recommend checking it out when you have a moment.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
10,"So far, we've focused on X-rays—but medical imaging goes way beyond that. In fact, it covers almost the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

Depending on what part of the spectrum you use, you get different kinds of information. For example:

Gamma rays are used in nuclear imaging, like PET and SPECT

Radio waves are instrumental in MRI

Visible and infrared light are for optical imaging

And even ultrasound, though not part of the EM spectrum, gives us mechanical wave-based imaging, referred to as ultrasound imaging.

Each imaging modality has its own strengths and weaknesses. Some are great for structure, others for function. Some are good at seeing bones, others at detecting molecular processes like metabolism or gene expression.

In fact, no single technique gives us the whole picture. That’s why modern medicine often combines them—what we call multimodal imaging. When we link them together, we get a rather rich view of what’s going on inside the body.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
11,"Let’s talk a bit more about what makes tomography special.

When you take a regular photo with your phone, you get a picture—that’s it. It’s a direct result of what the camera sees. But tomographic imaging is different. You don’t directly capture the image you want. Instead, you collect data from many different angles, and that data is a kind of indirect measurement—a projection of what's inside.

Now here’s the key part: to get a cross-sectional image, we need to do something called inversion. In other words, we take the measurements and reverse-engineer the internal structure that produced them.

This is an inverse problem. It’s different from the more familiar forward problem, where you know all the inputs, and a forward model, and calculate the outcome. Like in physics: you know the force and the mass, so you calculate how something moves.

In tomography, it’s the opposite. You see the outcome—the measurement—and you ask: what could have caused this? That’s a lot harder.

Here’s a fun analogy: think of boiling an egg. That’s a straightforward process. But what if someone gave you a boiled egg and said, “Unboil it”? That’s the inverse problem. Sounds impossible—but researchers have found ways to reverse that process under specific conditions. It’s challenging, but not hopeless. And that’s what makes inversion in imaging both difficult and exciting.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
12,"Here’s another example that might feel a bit more familiar.

Let’s say you take a photo with your phone, but it turns out a little blurry—maybe the camera shook, or the focus was off, or the camera is cheap and of poor quality. What you get is not the true image, but a version that’s been blurred in several ways.

Now, how do we describe that blurring? In image processing, we model it using something called a point spread function—or PSF for short. This describes how a single point of light spreads out in the image.

The process that causes blurring is called convolution. It’s a mathematical operation that combines the original image with the PSF. Convolution is sort of like multiplication—but in the so-called Fourier space that we will explain later in this course. Indeed, in the Fourier domain, convolution becomes regular multiplication. The Fourier transform is often performed using a fast algorithm, FFT in short. That simplifies a lot of computations.

But now comes the hard part: what if all you have is the blurry image? Can you work backward and recover the original, sharp version?

That’s another inverse problem. And just like with tomography, it’s tricky. You're trying to undo the effect of the blur, based on your knowledge of the system. It takes clever algorithms and good models—but it can be done. And that’s the kind of thinking we’ll develop throughout this course.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
13,"Let’s take a step back for a moment and think about how mathematics builds over time.

When you were in school, you learned the basics: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. These are the building blocks. But once you reach higher levels—like where we are now—those simple operations take on more advanced forms.

Take addition, for example. At this level, we’re not just adding a few numbers—we might be summing over an infinite number of values. That’s what integration is: it's a continuous version of addition, used when we add up contributions from every point in a region.

What about subtraction? In calculus, that becomes differentiation. Instead of just finding a difference between two numbers, we’re looking at how fast something is changing at an exact point by evaluating a very small difference of a smooth function between two rather close points.

Now let’s look at multiplication. In imaging, we move from regular multiplication to something called convolution—a fundamental concept in systems and signal processing. Convolution helps us model how a spatially-invariant linear system modifies a signal or an image. You’ll see this again and again in medical imaging. Again, a convolution in a spatial or time domain is a multiplication in the Fourier domain.

And finally, what about division? Here’s where things get interesting. The advanced version of division—where you’re trying to reverse a process—is what we call an inverse solution; the deblurring problem is a good example. You’re given a blurry image, and your job is to figure out what is the underlying ground truth image. And that’s essentially what we do in tomographic imaging.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
14,"Now, here’s the point: inversion is hard. Much harder than the forward process.

In a forward problem, you start with all the information, and you calculate the outcome. That’s usually pretty straightforward. But an inverse problem is the opposite: you’re starting with the outcome, and trying to infer what caused it.

And this is where things get tricky. There might be multiple possible answers, or the data might be noisy or incomplete. You need to bring in clever mathematics, algorithms, physical models, and prior knowledge to make sense of it all.

That’s why this course isn’t just about memorizing facts. It’s about developing your quantitative thinking and really understanding what’s going on underneath the surface. It’s challenging—but if you put in the effort, it’s also incredibly rewarding.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
15,"Now let’s take a moment to appreciate just how interdisciplinary medical imaging really is.

We’re combining mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering—all in one field. Think about that. Whether we’re modeling how X-rays interact with tissue, analyzing ultrasound signals, or designing contrast agents for optical imaging—we’re pulling from all corners of science and technology.

This means that medical imaging isn’t just about one skill set. It’s about thinking broadly and connecting the dots between different fields. And if you enjoy solving complex problems, this is one of the best places to be.

So by now, you should have a pretty good sense of what this course is about—and what makes it so special. We’ll focus on modern biomedical imaging technologies, and we’ll build the knowledge and tools needed to understand how they work, and how they’re used to help people.

And honestly, it’s really cool stuff.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
16,"So by now, you might be thinking—this is all very cool, but why do I really need to learn medical imaging?

Well, I’d say there are at least two solid reasons.

First—and perhaps most importantly—it gives you essential health-related knowledge. Whether you pursue a career in engineering, medicine, or something entirely different, understanding how imaging works can help you make sense of your own health and the health of those around you, during your hospital visits and afterwards.

The second reason is career-related. We’ll get to that more. But for now, just keep in mind—this is cool knowledge for a niche group of people. It’s personal and extremely useful in several ways; to say the least, it is a required course for your college education.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:

17,"Let me share something personal with you.

A couple of years ago, I had a kidney stone. Not fun. I ended up in the hospital, they injected a contrast agent, ran a CT scan, and just like that—they could see the size and location of the stone.

Now, because I understood what was going on, I wasn’t worried or confused. I could follow the diagnosis, and I knew what the doctors were looking for.

And honestly, sooner or later, most of us will have a medical scan—whether it’s an X-ray, a CT, or an MRI. And perhaps, all of them and multiple times. It could be you, or someone you love. When that happens, wouldn’t it be helpful to understand what those images mean?

That’s why this knowledge matters—not just in theory, but in real life.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
18,"Looking ahead, many of you will have families of your own. When a family member gets a scan or a test result, wouldn’t you want to understand what’s happening?

That’s where this course really empowers you.

Even if you don’t go into imaging research, even if you don’t become a radiologist or an imaging scientist, just being able to interpret results and ask the right questions can make a big difference.

So that’s the first reason: personal and practical value. Now let’s move on to the second one—your career.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

19,"Let’s zoom out for a moment and look at biomedical engineering as a field.

It’s one of the newest branches of engineering. Engineering started with disciplines like civil and mechanical, then moved into electrical, chemical, and aerospace. More recently, biomedical engineering emerged to bridge the gap between technology and medicine.

And it’s grown fast—because it’s relevant, it’s interdisciplinary, and it’s impactful.

In many universities, biomedical engineering includes at least two major focus areas. One is imaging, which is what we’re covering here. The other is tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, often called TERM.

Whether or not you plan to specialize in imaging, this course plays a foundational role. It builds your technical knowledge, strengthens your systems thinking, and helps you understand one of the most important technologies in healthcare today.

So if you’re here as part of your degree requirements—great. But don’t just treat it like a checkbox. Learn it well. It will pay off, academically, professionally, and personally.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

20,"Now, for those of you considering a concentration in imaging—or even just taking this course seriously—it can really pay off in your career.

Medical imaging is a technical field, but it’s also full of opportunities. If you understand how imaging systems work, and you can apply that knowledge to real-world problems, you’ll bring serious value to any team—whether in research, healthcare, or industry.

And in case you’re still wondering: yes, biomedical engineering is a great profession. It sits at the intersection of life sciences, medicine, and engineering—and that makes it both exciting and employable.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

21,"In fact, if you look at trends in job growth, biomedical engineering consistently ranks among the fastest-growing careers. Just take a glance at some recent employment reports—you’ll see biomedical engineers right near the top.

Why is that? Well, part of the reason is that healthcare is becoming more tech-driven. Devices, sensors, data analysis, machine learning—it all depends on people who can bridge the gap between biology and engineering.

22,"Now let’s zoom out to the global scale.

Medical imaging isn’t just a field—it’s a major global industry. And it’s growing fast. Countries around the world are investing heavily in imaging infrastructure, service, and innovation.

If you look at the data, regions like Asia and Europe are rapidly expanding their market share. Asia, in particular, has seen a surge in R&D spending and adoption of advanced imaging technologies. That means more jobs, more research funding, and more innovation coming from across the globe.

So, whether you're aiming for industry, academia, or entrepreneurship—this is a great space to be in.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

23,"When it comes to imaging modalities, CT and MRI continue to lead in market share and clinical use.

That’s no surprise—both are incredibly versatile and widely used across medical specialties. CT scans are fast and great for detailed anatomical views. MRI provides outstanding soft tissue contrast, which is essential in areas like cardiology and neurology.

You might be surprised, though, that nuclear imaging—like PET and SPECT—is also a major player. These techniques are critical for functional imaging and cancer imaging. They are becoming more popular as we move toward personalized and molecular medicine.

Each year, investment in these technologies grows. The message is clear: the field is fast evolving, and there’s a strong momentum behind it.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

24,"So now that we’ve seen how vital CT, MRI, and other imaging technologies are in practice and in the global market—here’s something interesting to reflect on.

A few years ago, a survey asked physicians and scientists to name the most important technological innovation of the entire 20th century. Think about that—this included everything: the internet, smartphones, even space travel.

And what came out on top? Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT). Not even close. These tomographic imaging technologies were voted number one by a considerable margin.

Why? Because they fundamentally changed how we diagnose and treat diseases. They let us see inside the human body in ways that were never possible before—accurately, noninvasively, and in real time.

As you go deeper into this course, you’ll learn how these systems work—so not only will you understand their value, you’ll also be able to explain it confidently in, say, a job interview or a professional conversation.

This is a company with a deep history of technological contributions, not just in medical imaging, but across many industries. And interestingly, “GE” also happens to be my initials—but theirs is with a capital E. So, no confusion!

GE was founded back in 1892, not long after X-rays were discovered. And Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was founded even earlier. So these two organizations have grown side by side, both focused on pushing the boundaries of science and technology.

In 1984, they played a critical role in the development of MRI systems. And in 1999, digital X-ray systems came out of their labs. They’ve consistently been at the forefront of translating ideas into real-world technologies. My lab and Global Research Center has been closely collaborating on medical imaging over decades.

Extract:

33,"We’ve designed this course with two major phases in mind: a foundation phase and a modality-specific phase. In the foundation phase—highlighted in light blue—you’ll build the critical background knowledge necessary to understand modern biomedical imaging systems. This includes essential concepts in linear systems, convolution, and Fourier analysis. These are the mathematical and conceptual tools at the heart of almost every imaging modality we’ll cover later.

Why this structure? Well, my previous experience with diverse students tells me that not everyone enters this course with the same preparation. Some of you may have strong backgrounds in physics, applied math, and electrical engineering—and that’s great. You might already be familiar with system theory and Fourier transform. But many others come from biology, chemistry, or material science backgrounds, where these topics are not emphasized. That’s completely okay.

Medical imaging is interdisciplinary—and complex. So my job is to guide all of you, regardless of background, to the point where you understand these core ideas clearly and intuitively. It won't be enough to just listen and watch these lectures. You’ll need to invest time in previewing and reviewing the materials and doing the assignments. But rest assured—your effort will pay off. These foundational topics will resurface again and again, especially in modalities like CT and MRI, where the Fourier transform is a key player.

Also, linear systems might look simple on the surface—after all, they obey additivity and scaling rules—but they come with nuances. One particularly subtle concept is convolution, which plays a crucial role in both systems analysis and image reconstruction. We’ll make sure you understand not just how to compute it, but also why it matters and how it shows up in real-world scanners.

So, we begin with the foundation. Later, we’ll shift to the modality phase, shown in dark green—where we delve into imaging techniques like X-ray CT, nuclear imaging, MRI, ultrasound, and optical imaging. Each one has unique physics, engineering principles, and clinical applications.

Think of it this way: the foundation is your universal imaging 'language'. Once you master it, learning each new modality becomes much easier, and far more meaningful.

Let me walk you through our tentative timeline for the course—though as with any plan, we may make some adjustments along the way.

This lecture kicks off the course. In our next session, you’ll be introduced to MATLAB. If you're unfamiliar with it, don’t worry—our teaching assistant will help you get started. MATLAB is a vital tool in imaging research, especially when modeling systems or reconstructing images from tomographic data. After the introduction, you’ll have a short MATLAB-related assignment to sharpen your skills.

Then we move into the foundation module—the light blue section. This is where we cover the theoretical concepts that apply across imaging technologies. After that, we transition to the green section—where we examine individual imaging modalities.

You’ll also be evaluated through three closed-book exams spaced across the course: one after the foundation module, one after the first set of modalities (CT and nuclear imaging), and one to cover everything else. Your final grade will be based on a combination of these exams, your homework, and participation.

Now, this is an online course, so we’ve adapted all the content accordingly. Pre-recorded lectures, interactive demos, and exercises will all be made available. If you have questions, we encourage you to reach out via the discussion forum or email. Quick responses are part of our commitment to help you succeed.

A quick tip: spend quality time understanding the Fourier transform early on. It’s a recurring theme. And if you’ve ever wondered why exponential functions like 
𝑒^𝑖𝜃 show up everywhere, this course will make that connection crystal clear. We’ll discuss how they lead to elegant mathematical representations and how these expressions play into image formation.

Finally, one last point. This course is not just about passing exams—it’s about equipping you with a deep understanding that you can carry forward into research, engineering design, and healthcare work. Let’s work together and learn from each other.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

34,"For the modality-specific portion of the course—the dark green section—we’ll be using the green textbook: Introduction to Biomedical Imaging by Andrew Webb. It’s available online or through our university bookstore.

This book isn’t very thick, but it’s well-structured and written with clarity. Even though it was published a while ago, the fundamental principles it covers haven’t changed. Physics is timeless in that way. We’ll supplement the book with more recent findings, particularly in areas like deep learning for image reconstruction, low-dose imaging, and multi-modal fusion—advances that have significantly shaped the field over past several years.

The textbook will guide your learning, especially in the second part of the course. For the foundation topics like linear systems and Fourier theory, we’ll use tailored lecture notes and curated readings, because unfortunately, there’s no single book that explains everything in a concise and consistent manner for students from all backgrounds.

35,"In addition to our course materials, I’d like to mention a particularly helpful supplementary resource that aligns well with the foundation we’re covering—especially Fourier transforms and linear systems.

Stanford University offers an excellent course titled 'EE261: The Fourier Transform and Its Applications'. It’s taught by Professor Brad Osgood, and the best part is that it is freely available online through Stanford’s SEE platform. You can access the full textbook there and watch high-quality lecture videos.

Now, a quick word of caution: the Stanford course spans an entire semester. The book is over 400 pages long. Don’t feel overwhelmed. You absolutely do not need to cover all of it. Think of it as a reference companion to our course. In fact, for our purposes, reading even 80–100 pages from selected sections will be more than enough to reinforce your understanding.

What makes this resource valuable is the clarity and consistency of its explanations and mathematical treatment. It builds the theory from the ground up, with elegant examples and a style that’s both rigorous and readable. If you ever find yourself puzzled by a concept I introduce—say, the derivation of the Fourier series, or the intuition behind convolution—this book can offer a second viewpoint. Sometimes, a slightly different presentation is all you need for clarity.

However, please note that we will follow our own structured path in this course. For example, I introduce linear systems before Fourier transforms, because in imaging, systems thinking provides the conceptual grounding. The Stanford course takes the reverse order. Both are valid—but here, we start with linear systems to better prepare for their applications in imaging modalities like CT and MRI.

Please use this Stanford material as a valuable supplement, not a replacement. You’ll benefit most by following our course flow carefully and referring to the Stanford book only when you want to go deeper or review challenging topics.

Lastly, although I have reached out for formal permission, the material seems publicly accessible and openly shared for educational use. So, feel free to explore it from your own dorm room, your library, or anywhere you study.

37,"Continuing from our previous discussions, let’s dive into the physics of X-ray imaging and how we can collect and process data to reconstruct an image.

In X-ray imaging, we start with the concept of a line integral. Essentially, the X-rays pass through the object, and what we measure is the energy of penetrated x-ray photons and then compute the line integral along the x-ray path. Such line integrals together form the Radon transform. To make it simpler, imagine you have an object, and you put all line integrals from a specific direction to form an x-ray projection. This projection is a one-dimensional profile, which is the information you can get along all the X-ray paths passing through the object in that direction.

Now, let’s take this idea into the realm of mathematics. We start with a 2D image, denoted as 
f(x,y). When we have all x-ray projections or the Radon transform, we get a new 2D function  p(θ,t), where  t is the coordinate along the 1D detector array and  θ is the projection orientation. By changing the angle θ, we rotate the data acquisition system to gather x-ray projections.

Now, the magic happens when we flip the process around. Given this collected projection dataset, our goal is to reconstruct the original 2D image f(x,y). This is the inverse process, and here’s where things get interesting: by perform the 1D Fourier trans of each and every of the 1D projections, we move into the Fourier domain.

To put it simply, the 1D projections we collect represent profiles in the frequency domain. By rotating the data acquisition system, we eventually capture the entire Fourier space. And once we have all the data in the Fourier space, we can apply the inverse Fourier transform to reconstruct the original image. This process connects the data from the physical object to the Fourier spectrum of the underlying image, and from the Fourier spectrum, we can reconstruct the original image.

While this overview gives you the fundamental idea, later in the course, we’ll dive deeper into the Fourier transform, why they can be inverted, and how this mathematical framework ties directly to the imaging process. But for now, keep in mind that the forward process (how we collect data) and the inverse process (how we reconstruct the image) are two sides of the same coin, closely linked by Fourier analysis.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

38,"Continuing with our exploration of imaging modalities, let’s now discuss Positron Emission Tomography, or PET. While the previous imaging techniques focused on capturing the anatomical structure, PET offers a powerful way to visualize the functional activity in the human body.

So, how does it work? Well, the key to PET is the introduction of radioactive tracers into the body. These tracers are typically radioactive chemicals that participate in your body’s metabolic processes. For example, tumors tend to consume a lot of glucose. If we couple glucose molecules with a radioactive tracer, we can track how much glucose the tumor is using, which directly correlates with its activity. Tumors, which are often highly metabolic, will naturally absorb more of this tracer.

Once the PET tracer is in the body, it begins to emit gamma ray photons in pairs, and two photons in a pair will travel in opposite directions. Gamma rays, much like X-rays, can penetrate through tissues and be detected externally. When we receive gamma ray photons from two different detector locations, we know they originated from the same event somewhere on the line connecting the two detectors.
This process is similar to the measurement of line integrals used for CT. Then, we can apply Fourier analysis to reconstruct the images. In PET, Fourier transforms help us create detailed, functional images of the body’s processes. The goal here is to understand how much activities are happening at specific locations. So, while we’ve seen how CT gives us anatomical details, PET allows us to observe the biological functions—like metabolism—within those structures.

This modality is especially useful for identifying cancerous tissues, studying brain function, and even monitoring heart conditions. Later, we’ll explain how the gamma ray photons are detected and processed to reconstruct these functional images. But for now, remember that PET imaging provides us with a way to look inside the body not just for its structure, but also for how physiology is actively working.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

39,"Now, let’s explore a closely related imaging technique in nuclear medicine called Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography, or SPECT. While Positron Emission Tomography (PET) relies on the detection of paired gamma ray photons emitted from the tracer, SPECT works differently.

In SPECT, the radio tracer emits gamma ray photons randomly and individually, without being paired. Essentially, instead of detecting two photons coming from opposite directions (as we do in PET), we measure single gamma ray photons emitted from a radioactive tracer within the body.

When a photon is detected through a collimator, we know it came from a particular path through the patient body, but since the photons are not paired, we need to use different data preprocessing and image reconstruction methods. SPECT provides valuable information, but it’s a bit different from PET. In SPECT, we capture these single photons from various angles around the body and use dedicated tomographic reconstruction techniques to create an image.

We’ll discuss the details of SPECT imaging later in the course, but for now, keep in mind that while PET relies on paired photons to provide highly precise spatial information, SPECT uses single photons to gather functional information in a different way. Both PET and SPECT produce tomographic images of radio-tracer activities.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

40,"Now, let’s turn our attention to the third major imaging modality: Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRI. MRI uses a completely different approach compared to X-ray and nuclear imaging techniques including PET and SPECT. In MRI, we utilize radio frequency signals to gather detailed images of the body.

Here’s how it works: First, we subject the patient to a very strong magnetic field. This magnetic field aligns the hydrogen nuclei—which are abundant in water molecules in your body. Then, we introduce a radio frequency (RF) signal that briefly disrupts this alignment, causing the hydrogen nuclei to emit their own radio frequency signals as they return to their original stable state.

The key advantage of MRI is that it is sensitive to the water content in different tissues and interactions of hydrogen nuclei with their micro-environments, which makes MRI extremely useful for imaging soft tissues like the brain, muscles, and organs. The signal we collect can give us a lot of valuable information, such as chemical shifts in tissues, which help us distinguish between different types of tissues and even detect abnormalities like tumors or inflammation.

MRI is also great for studying brain activity, as the technique can be used to observe changes in blood flow over time. This makes MRI not only a structural imaging tool but also a functional one, adding a layer of depth to our understanding of the body.

Together with CT and nuclear imaging techniques, MRI forms the trio of most important imaging modalities. While CT focuses on capturing detailed anatomical structures using X-rays, and nuclear imaging provides insight into physiological functions, MRI offers unmatched soft tissue contrast and the ability to examine both structure and function in a non-invasive way, even into our thinking processes.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

41,"Now, let's look at Ultrasound Imaging. While it might not be as widely discussed or as advanced as the big three—CT, nuclear imaging, and MRI—ultrasound remains a powerful, affordable, and safe imaging tool in medical practice, and seems playing an increasingly important role for point of care imaging.

So, how does ultrasound work? It operates based on the principle of mechanical vibrations. In ultrasound imaging, we use a device called a transducer, which contains piezoelectric materials. These materials can generate high-frequency sound waves when subjected to an electric current. These sound waves are then sent into the body.

As the sound waves travel through tissues, they interact with various structures inside the body. Some waves are reflected, and others continue through the tissues. The reflected waves are detected by the transducer, and from this data, we can reconstruct an image of the internal structures. Essentially, we’re mapping the body’s anatomy based on how sound waves bounce off tissues.

One of the greatest benefits of ultrasound is that it’s non-invasive and completely safe—unlike X-rays or CT scans, ultrasound doesn't involve ionizing radiation. It’s also incredibly cost-effective and high-speed, which makes it a go-to tool for many real-time imaging tasks. You’ll often see it used during fetal imaging in pregnancy, as well as in blood flow monitoring and guiding biopsies.

While it may not provide the same level of detail as MRI or CT, ultrasound’s affordability, speed, and safety make it a valuable tool for many clinical applications. Coupled with AI methods, ultrasound imaging has yet more to offer.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

42,"Now, let’s talk about Optical Imaging, another fascinating imaging modality that uses visible and infrared light. Unlike the other imaging techniques we've discussed, optical imaging focuses on how light interacts with cells, allowing us to reveal molecular and cellular interactions in the body.

One unique aspect of optical imaging is its ability to extract signatures from these biological interactions, providing valuable information about what’s happening at a microscopic level. This is where things get exciting! For example, we can use luminescence probes to tag specific proteins or gene expressions. Once tagged, these proteins will emit a luminescent light and make them visible to our imaging system.

Think of it like the glow of a firefly in a summer night. When certain proteins or cells are tagged, they emit bioluminescent light, which we can detect. This is a form of passive imaging, meaning the light we need to detect is emitted by the body itself, rather than steered by any external light source.

For example, in a typical experiment, an animal might be placed in a dark room, and we would observe the light emissions coming from specific areas on its body. We want to perform tomographic reconstruction to find the internal distribution of the bioluminescent sources. For that purpose, we combine an optical imager with a separate tomographic scanner, which helps us get both the anatomy and the optical properties of organs and structures to build a forward imaging model. After that, we can invert this forward model for reconstruction of a 3D distribution of bioluminescent sources.

The real challenge in optical imaging isn’t in the forward process—where we predict the external signal based on the known internal structures. The difficulty is in the inverse process, where we have this inverse problem: Given the external light signals we measure, how do we reconstruct the distribution of bioluminescent sources inside the body?

To do this, we use multiple mirrors to collect all the emitted light, creating a complete set of external views. We then use this data to reconstruct the internal light source distribution. This method has been known as bioluminescence tomography that we pioneered and has become quite popular in the literature.

Note that optical imaging includes a good number of techniques.  Bioluminescence tomography is only one of them. We have fluorescence tomography as well, with fluorescence probes excitable by an external laser source. More clinically important is optical coherence tomography or OCT, which is used to check your retina in eye clinic.

In summary, optical imaging, like other modalities, allows us to visualize and understand structures, probes or tracers inside the body. It’s a unique and powerful way to study biology from the inside out.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

43,"Now that we’ve explored the different imaging modalities and how they allow us to visualize features inside the body, the next logical step is to talk about what we can do with the images we’ve acquired. Once you have an image, you don’t just look at it—you analyze it to gain task-specific information. This is where the domain of image processing grows.

In medicine, image analysis is crucial for extracting actionable insights. There are various techniques we use, such as image segmentation, where we identify specific regions or structures within the image—like tumors, organs, or blood vessels. By doing this, we can focus on areas of interest, making it easier to understand what’s happening inside the body.

Another important tool is image classification, which allows us to categorize different structures or tissues based on their visual features. This helps doctors make diagnosis, track changes over time, or even guide interventional procedures. 

We also use techniques like image enhancement, which improves the quality of the image by making certain features more visible, such as image deblurring, which sharpens images that might have been blurry due to motion or technical issues.

Some textbooks on medical imaging even include image visualization. This is where new technologies like augmented reality (AR) become relevant. I recently read an article, where the use of AR is discussed for medical imaging-guided surgery. With this innovative method, surgeons wear specialized glasses that overlay imaging data directly onto the patient’s body during surgery, guiding their actions in real time. While this is an exciting application of medical imaging, for the scope of this course, we’ll focus more on bio-imaging and bio-instrumentation, with an emphasis on tomographic imaging.

44,"To put everything in perspective, let’s take a step back and look at the big picture. In understanding the human body, we often talk about two key concepts: phenotype and genotype.

Genotype refers to your genetic makeup—the DNA that gives rise to your traits. Meanwhile, phenotype refers to the observable characteristics of an individual, such as physical traits, biological functions, and disease states. Biomedical imaging plays a crucial role in studying the phenotype. Through imaging, we can visualize and analyze the biological structures and functions that define an individual’s phenotype.

Now, bioinformatics and genetic profiling give us a lot of information about the genotype—things like your genetic predispositions and variations. However, these genetic insights need to be connected to the physical manifestation of the genes—the phenotype. We can use biomedical imaging to observe and understand the effects of genetic factors on the body.

While we’re entering the world of imaging in this course, it’s important to recognize that we’re focusing primarily on phenotype—how imaging allows us to visualize and analyze the body's structures and functions. However, linking genotype (your genetic information) with phenotype (the observable traits and conditions) is an essential goal for personalized medicine. This connection between the two will allow for more accurate diagnosis, more effective treatment, and unprecedented prediction in the future.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

What does this mean? The combination of medical imaging with machine learning, especially deep learning, holds enormous potential for the future of diagnostics, treatment planning, and personalized medicine. This intersection is where we can expect to see transformative changes in how we approach medical imaging. The ability to reconstruct, analyze and interpret medical images with AI-empowered algorithms opens doors to endless possibilities.

16,"Alright, let’s shift gears and talk about solving systems of linear equations — something that comes up all the time in engineering, physics, and, yes, even in medical imaging.
Suppose we’re working with a system like A times x equals b. Now, you might think — okay, just take the inverse of A and multiply it by b. So, x equals inv of A times b.
And sure, that’s mathematically valid — but in practice, it’s a bad idea. It’s slow, it’s unstable, and it can lead to all kinds of numerical issues, especially with large or ill-conditioned matrices.
Instead, MATLAB gives us a much better tool: the backslash operator. So we write x equals A backslash b. This tells MATLAB to choose the most efficient way to solve the system behind the scenes — no explicit inverse needed.
Later on, we’ll learn how to implement our own solvers, but for now, this built-in method is what you should use. It’s clean, fast, and accurate — everything we want.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

17,"Now that we’ve seen how to work with equations, let’s take a moment to explore how we can inspect the structure of the data we’re working with — vectors and matrices.
To find out how long a vector is, just use length — so length of v tells you how many elements it has.
If you’re working with a matrix, and you want to know its shape — how many rows and columns — just use size of A.
Want to check if a matrix is full rank? That’s easy — rank of A will do the job.
And when we want to understand how large a matrix or vector is in terms of magnitude, we use the norm function. Just norm of A gives the 2-norm by default — that’s the square root of the sum of squares. You can also ask for specific norms like the 1-norm using norm of A, one, or the infinity norm with norm of A, inf.

18,"Let’s talk about control flow — specifically, loops.
Start with a for loop. Use it when you know how many times you want to repeat something.
For example:Set x to zero.Then, for i from 1 to 5 in steps of 2 — so, 1, 3, and 5 —we add i to x.At the end, x equals 9.
for loops are useful when working through a known sequence.
Now, a while loop runs as long as a condition is true.
In this example:Start with x equal to 7.While x is greater than or equal to zero, subtract 2 each time.The loop stops when x becomes negative.
Just be careful — if the condition never becomes false, the loop won’t stop.
Finally, break lets you exit a loop early.It’s useful if you find what you need before the loop finishes.In nested loops, it only exits the innermost one.Use it wisely — don’t skip steps that still matter.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

You might say:“If x is equal to 3, display: the value of x is 3.If x is equal to 5, display: the value of x is 5.Otherwise, display: the value of x is not 3 or 5.”
This allows the program to choose what to do based on the value of x.
Now, when you want to check one variable against several specific values, a switch statement is better.

For example:“If face is 1, say: rolled a one.If face is 2, say: rolled a two.Otherwise, say: rolled a number greater than or equal to three.”

20,"Now let’s talk about vectorization — one of the most important habits in MATLAB programming.
Here’s the idea. Instead of looping through each element one by one, we apply an operation to the whole array at once.
For example:Let’s say x is the vector — one, two, three.Using a loop, we would add five to each element, one at a time.But with vectorization, we just say: x equals x plus five — and MATLAB does it all at once.

Use f scanf to read numbers from the file.When you're done, always close the file using f close.
If you need formatting help, use help textread or help f printf.

26,"Let’s now learn how to read data files in MATLAB — both fully and partially.
To read an entire structured dataset, you first open the file using fopen, then use the textread function to extract data from all columns.
Each data type in the file corresponds to a format symbol — like %s for strings, %f for floating-point numbers, and %d for integers. MATLAB assigns each column to a variable automatically.
This works well when you need to load the whole dataset into memory — like names, types, values, and so on.
Now, if you only want to read part of the data — say just the first column — you can still use textread, but with asterisks added to the format string to skip over the columns you don’t need. MATLAB will still move through the file correctly, but it’ll only save the data you asked for.

This is great for tracking your workflow, recording sessions, or saving what you’ve done for future reference or reporting.

Now, let’s talk about indexing. If you have a matrix A:A of i comma j gives the element in row i and column j.A of i comma colon gives the entire i-th row.A of colon comma j gives the whole j-th column.
You can reshape matrices, slice out parts, or use logical masks to filter data.

In each chapter, I aim for a balanced structure: we start with three main sections, followed by a concluding section with remarks and points for deeper thought. In this lecture, we’ll begin with general systems, then narrow our focus to linear systems—which, as the name suggests, behave in a straightforward, predictable way, much like linear functions in mathematics.
To qualify as a linear system, two properties must be satisfied: additivity and homogeneity. Together, these form what we call the superposition principle. We’ll break these ideas down, explore when one property implies the other, and consider whether they are truly independent requirements. Lastly, we’ll touch on nonlinear systems—which are simply systems that don’t meet these linearity conditions.

A function is a mathematical rule that maps each input from one set, called the domain, to an output in another set, called the range. Systems work in a similar way. They take an input, process it through interconnected elements, and produce an output.
These elements could represent anything: parts of a social system, components of a physiological system, or pieces of a mechanical system. The important point is that both functions and systems describe relationships between inputs and outputs.

Each added term improves the approximation, as long as certain conditions are met to ensure the series converges.

9,"As engineers, we often think of the world in terms of systems. We use mathematical operators—like L or O—to describe how a system transforms an input into an output. If you feed an input signal, V, into a system, the output, W, represents how that signal is modified.
These inputs and outputs can take many forms: time-dependent signals, images, tensors, or even discrete data sets like color values in an image. The concept is general: a system processes an input and produces an output, just as a function maps domain to range.
In medical imaging, we apply this thinking to devices like CT scanners, where the entire system transforms physical signals into diagnostic images. And as we analyze these systems, we rely on mathematical relationships to describe their behavior in precise terms.

In fact, measurement is at the heart of both engineering and physics. For example, in quantum mechanics, measurement plays a critical role—until we measure, we don’t truly know a system’s state. It’s like the famous thought experiment with Schrödinger’s cat: is the cat alive or dead? Only measurement collapses the uncertainty into reality.
When we perform measurements, we typically have input variables and sometimes a reference. Consider weighing an object: we place a known weight on one side of a balance and the object on the other. If the balance is level, we know the object’s weight equals the standard. Similarly, in electrical measurements, we might compare an unknown resistance or voltage against a reference using an ohmmeter or a multimeter. These devices let us measure things like current, resistance, and capacitance with precision.
More broadly, think of an instructor as a system: when the calendar says it’s time for class, that’s the input. The output is the lecture.

Ideally, this image is a faithful representation—a sharp, clear point corresponds exactly to a sharp point in the body.
But not all systems are created equal. A high-quality system will produce sharp, high-contrast images, while a less precise system might blur details, much like how a low-resolution camera produces softer, less defined pictures. This blurring is a key characteristic of the system and tells us a lot about its performance.

17,"Given the vast complexity of all these systems, we need to narrow our focus. That’s why in this course, we concentrate on linear systems—the simplest and most important class of systems, especially in medical imaging. Linear systems are manageable to study, yet powerful in their applications. Once we master them, we’ll be ready to tackle the greater complexity of nonlinear systems.
In a linear system, two key properties must hold: additivity and homogeneity. Together, these form the superposition principle.

18,"Let’s look at additivity first. If you know how a system responds to input F1, producing output K1, and separately how it responds to input F2, producing K2, then additivity tells us the system’s response to F1 + F2 is simply K1 + K2. This property allows us to analyze complex inputs by breaking them into simpler parts—a key advantage in engineering.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

19,"Now consider homogeneity, or the scaling property. If a system produces output K1 for input F1, then scaling the input—multiplying it by some factor—should scale the output by the same factor. For example, if we double the brightness of an image input, the output image should also be twice as bright.
These two properties—additivity and homogeneity—are at the heart of linear systems. Understanding them clearly is essential, because they allow us to predict how systems behave, simplify complex problems, and build reliable imaging technologies.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

20,"Let’s test these ideas with a few examples. Suppose we have a system that maps positive numbers, x, to the square root of x. Is this system linear? Well, while the output is zero when the input is zero, that alone doesn’t make a system linear. Remember, true linearity requires both additivity and homogeneity. The square root function doesn’t satisfy either—if you take two inputs and sum their square roots, that doesn’t equal the square root of the sum, and scaling the input doesn’t scale the output proportionally.
On the other hand, consider a linear transformation in three-dimensional space, like multiplying a vector by a 3×3 matrix. This kind of operation satisfies both additivity and homogeneity, making it a linear system. Similarly, mathematical operations like integration and differentiation also qualify as linear operators.

21,"Over the years, some have argued that the definition of a linear system might be redundant—perhaps additivity alone implies homogeneity, or vice versa. This is an intriguing idea, and it reminds us that crafting precise definitions, like those in mathematics or geometry, is both an art and a science. Just as Euclid defined geometry with five foundational postulates, and mathematicians later debated whether all were independent, we can ask similar questions about system properties.

22,"For continuous functions, additivity and homogeneity can indeed be shown to be equivalent. For example, if a system satisfies additivity, you can use that property repeatedly to demonstrate homogeneity for integer scalars, rational scalars, and ultimately for all real scalars, thanks to continuity. Conversely, if a system satisfies homogeneity, you can reason your way back to additivity.
But this also points to a larger truth: when building formal systems—whether in mathematics or engineering—we must ensure they are logically consistent. This is no trivial task, and it’s part of what makes formal reasoning so challenging and rewarding.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

23,"However, equivalence doesn’t always hold. Consider the complex conjugate operation. This system satisfies additivity: the conjugate of a sum equals the sum of the conjugates. But it fails homogeneity when the scalar is complex, because conjugating a scalar times a complex number doesn’t give the same result as scaling the conjugate by that scalar. This shows that additivity doesn’t always imply homogeneity—you really do need to check both.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

24,"Similarly, it’s possible to have homogeneity without additivity. Imagine a function that applies one slope if the input is rational and another slope if it’s irrational. Scaling works consistently because multiplying by a rational scalar preserves the input’s type (rational or irrational), so homogeneity holds. But if you add two irrational inputs that sum to a rational number, the slopes change—and additivity breaks down.
These examples remind us why linear systems require both properties. We can’t shortcut the definition by assuming one implies the other in all cases.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

The equation looks straightforward: next year’s population depends on this year’s population and a growth rate factor, r. But because of the nonlinear term involving the population itself, the system’s behavior changes dramatically depending on the value of r.
When the population is small, growth is nearly linear. But as the population approaches the environment’s limits, growth slows—resources become scarce, and the population stabilizes or even declines.

This is chaos in a mathematical sense: a deterministic system, governed by precise rules, but with outputs that seem random because they’re so sensitive to initial conditions.

4,"Let’s refresh our picture of a linear, shift-invariant system.
Imagine dropping a pebble into a still pond. No matter where the pebble lands, the ripples that form spread out in the same circular pattern. This uniformity — where the system’s response doesn’t change based on where the input occurs — is what we call shift-invariance.

Now, relate this to medical imaging. Suppose you undergo a scan at one hospital today and another hospital next week. If your physiological condition hasn’t changed, you’d expect the scans to look the same. That’s shift-invariance in action — it ensures reliability across time and space.

Next, we have linearity. It has two key components:
Additivity — if two features exist, like two separate tumors, the system should show the combination of both clearly.
Homogeneity — if a feature changes in intensity, like a tumor growing larger, the imaging should reflect that change proportionally.

Together, these properties form what’s known as the superposition principle — the foundation for much of modern system analysis, including medical imaging.
So, as we move ahead, keep the ripple analogy in mind. It's a simple yet powerful way to visualize how linear, shift-invariant systems behave — consistently, predictably, and truthfully.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

5,"To understand convolution deeply, let’s frame it through a familiar story from physics.
You might recall the idea — sometimes attributed to Newton — that the universe began with a single impulse, a sort of divine kick that set everything into motion. Whether metaphor or mechanics, this idea captures something fundamental.
In physics, we often model this idea of an initial force as an impulse — a very short burst of energy that sets a system into motion. For instance, think of hitting a golf ball with a club. That brief push is an impulse, and the ball's subsequent motion is the system’s response.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

6,"Let’s take a closer look at what that impulse does.

When you strike a stationary object, like a golf ball, the force you apply doesn’t last long — it’s concentrated over a short time. But that momentary push has a lasting effect: it changes the ball’s velocity and sets it into motion.
This simple interaction captures an essential principle: an impulse causes change.

In the context of system analysis, we’re interested in how a system responds over time after receiving an impulse. That response — often called the impulse response — tells us how the system behaves dynamically. Once we know the impulse response, we can use convolution to determine the system’s output for any more complex input signal.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:

7,"Let’s look at how impulse relates to momentum — a key concept in both physics and system analysis.
Momentum, as you may recall, is simply mass multiplied by velocity. 

So if an object is at rest, it has zero momentum. When you apply a force over a period of time — say, when you hit a tennis ball with a racket — the object gains velocity. That change in velocity reflects a change in momentum.

Now here’s the essential link:Impulse is defined as force multiplied by the time over which it acts.
We start with Newton’s second law, which tells us:Force equals mass times acceleration — or simply,F equals m a.

Now, acceleration is defined as the change in velocity divided by the change in time — so we write:a equals delta v over delta t.

If we substitute that into Newton’s law, we get:F times delta t equals m times delta v.

This equation shows us something powerful:Impulse — that’s force times time — equals the change in momentum.
tells us that impulse causes the change in momentum.


 It’s the way to model how mechanical systems respond to external inputs, and the idea applies to other input-output relationships as well.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

8,"Building on what we just discussed, here we observe something quite elegant:
The shape of the force curve — whether it’s a tall narrow spike or a wide shallow push — doesn’t actually matter when it comes to total impulse. What truly matters is the area under the force-time curve.

This area represents the cumulative effect of the force. So, a small force applied over a long duration can have the same impulse as a large force applied for a short time.

In system terms, different kinds of inputs can result in the same response if their total impact — the area — is identical.
This idea is central to convolution: we’re not just tracking individual values, but the accumulated effect of an input across time.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

9,"Now let’s extend that idea.
Impulse isn’t limited to rectangular shapes. We can see in this graph that different Gaussian curves — whether wide or narrow, flat or sharp — can all serve as impulse-like inputs.

What matters is the area under each curve. This area represents the total impulse delivered by the force, regardless of how the function looks. As long as that area remains the same, the impact on the system is the same.
This insight is critical in both physics and engineering: we often abstract away the exact shape of a signal and focus instead on its integrated effect — the impulse.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

10,"This brings us to an important mathematical idea — the limiting process, which gives us a way to model an ideal impulse.
Let’s define a simple function — we’ll call it d tau of t.
It’s equal to one divided by two tau when t is between minus tau and tau.
And it’s equal to zero everywhere else.
So again:
d tau of t equals one over two tau, if t is greater than minus tau and less than tau.Otherwise, it’s zero.
Now, as tau gets smaller and smaller, this function becomes taller and narrower, but the area under the curve remains exactly one.

That’s the key. As we shrink the width to zero — and the height grows without bound — we approach the Dirac delta function.
Mathematically, we say:
The limit of d tau of t, as tau approaches zero, is zero everywhere except at t equals zero.And at the same time,The limit of the area under the curve — capital I of tau — is equal to one.
In other words, the delta function is infinitely narrow, infinitely tall, and yet has a finite area of one.

This makes it a perfect tool for modeling ideal impulses, especially when we need to represent quick, concentrated energy or a sharp event in time.
And this idea will become central as we move into our discussion of convolution, where impulse responses help us understand how systems behave in response to various inputs.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

11,"Let’s take a moment to reflect on why the limiting process is essential when defining an impulse.
You might wonder — if we already know an impulse gives us the desired effect, like setting a golf ball in motion, why go through the trouble of idealizing it mathematically? The reason lies in precision. By applying the limiting process, we create a perfect, universal model of an impulse, one that’s as rigorous as the definition of a derivative in calculus.
Think of how we define a derivative: we take a small change, and by letting that change approach zero, we achieve an exact result. We’re doing something similar here with the Dirac delta function.

Now, regarding the shape of the delta function — does it matter? In fact, no. What matters is the area under the curve, not how the curve looks. It’s like receiving payment: whether it comes in one sum or in smaller installments, the total value is what counts.

Interestingly, if you start worrying about the exact shape without measuring it, you’re in uncertain territory. Without measurement, all shapes are possible — a bit like the probabilistic world of quantum mechanics! Only when we observe or measure do we know what’s truly there.

12,"Let’s take a deeper look at the Dirac delta function — one of the most powerful concepts in system analysis.
The delta function is what we call a generalized function, or in mathematical terms, a distribution. It helps us model a perfect impulse — something that delivers a concentrated effect at a single moment in time.

Now, here’s how we describe it mathematically:
We say that delta of t minus t naught equals zero for all values of t not equal to t naught.And, when we integrate this delta function from minus infinity to infinity, the result is one.
What does that mean?
It means the function is zero everywhere — except at one specific point in time, which we call t naught. At that single point, it has an infinitely sharp spike, but the area under the spike is exactly one. That area is what we call the impulse.
So even though we can’t see or draw the spike perfectly, we know that its total effect — the impulse — is one. That’s what matters. The effect is important, but the exact shape doesn’t matter.

Now, let’s shift to the discrete version of the delta function — something we use in digital systems.
We define delta of n like this:
It equals one when n is zero,and it equals zero for all other values of n.

In other words, this function is zero everywhere — except at n equals zero, where it has a value of one.It’s a single pulse — like a quick tap — at a specific point in time.

We can also shift this pulse. For example, delta of n minus two just moves the pulse to position n equals two.

This simple pulse is incredibly useful. It forms the building block for discrete-time convolution, which we’ll talk about next.
So both the continuous and discrete versions of the delta function help us analyze how systems respond to input — whether we’re dealing with real-world signals or digital data.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

13,"Before we explore how the delta function models sampling, let’s take a quick look at the integral mean value theorem — a fundamental concept from calculus.
Imagine we have a continuous function plotted over the interval from a to b. The area under the curve — shaded in green on the slide — is found by integrating the function from a to b.

Now, here’s what the mean value theorem says:Somewhere between a and b, there’s at least one point, which we’ll call c, where the height of the function at that point — f of c — multiplied by the width of the interval, gives you the same area as the one under the curve.
It’s like finding a rectangle with the same base and the same area — it represents the ""average"" value of the function across the interval.

This concept of ""average value over a short interval"" will help us understand how the delta function works when it comes to sampling a continuous function.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:

14,"Let’s now connect this idea directly to the delta function and its role in sampling.
Imagine you have a continuous function — let’s call it f of t. Now, if you multiply this function by a shifted delta function, specifically delta of t minus t naught, and then integrate, something powerful happens:
You end up extracting the value of f at t naught. In other words, the delta function acts like a perfect sampling tool.
Mathematically, this is shown through a limiting process. As the width of the delta function shrinks toward zero, its height increases — but the total area remains one. That’s key.
Inside this narrow window around t naught, the function f is essentially flat — and using the mean value theorem, we know there must be some point where the function's value equals the average over that interval. As the window becomes infinitesimally small, that point converges exactly to t naught.
So what do we get?

The integral from minus infinity to infinity of delta of t minus t naught, times f of t, d t — equals f of t naught.
This is called the sampling property of the delta function. It’s as if the delta function ""reaches into"" the function and pulls out the value at a single point.
Even more fascinating — we can actually rebuild any continuous function using this idea. By stacking many delta functions across time, each weighted by the function’s value at that point, we can reconstruct the entire function. Think of it like slicing the function into tiny pieces — each slice tells us something, and when you add them all together, you get the full picture again.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

15,"Let’s now think about how this idea translates to the discrete case.
You can visualize a discrete function as a collection of rectangular bars — sometimes called gate functions. These bars represent values at specific, evenly spaced points — like sampling a continuous function at fixed intervals.
Here you can see the mathematical expression in this slide.

This function is defined piecewise as follows:
It equals zero when the absolute value of t is greater than one-half,
It equals one-half when the absolute value of t is exactly one-half,
And it equals one when the absolute value of t is less than one-half.
In other words, the rectangular function is centered at zero, has a total width of one, and represents a simple, finite pulse — like a short “on” signal.

At the bottom of the slide, we define the discrete delta function, written as delta of n.
It equals one when n is zero, and zero otherwise.
So delta of n is a single spike located at n equals zero.If we shift it, like delta of n minus two, the spike moves to n equals two.

18,"Now that we’ve developed an understanding of the delta function and its role in modeling discrete events, let’s take this idea a step further and see how we can use it to represent an entire discrete function.

Here we observe a powerful mathematical concept: any discrete function — let’s call it g of n — can be expressed as a weighted sum of shifted delta functions. That is, we take the delta function, shift it to the appropriate position, and scale it by the function’s value at that point. When we add all these together, we recover the original function.
Here you can see the mathematical expression in this slide.

This formula tells us that each sample of g contributes one impulse, located at n equals k, and scaled by g at that k. When we add up all these scaled and shifted impulses, we rebuild the function g.

Let’s look at a specific example to make this concrete.

Suppose your discrete function consists of just a few nonzero points. The first point is at n equals 0 with value 1 — that’s just delta of n.
The second point is at n equals 1 with a value of negative 1 — so we write that as minus delta of n minus 1.
And the third point is at n equals 2 with a value of 1.5 — which becomes 1.5 times delta of n minus 2.

By adding these three impulses together, we effectively reconstruct the original signal, point by point.

This approach is not only elegant, it’s also foundational in signal processing and linear systems. It allows us to treat any discrete-time signal as a sum of building blocks — scaled and shifted impulses — making analysis and filtering much easier later on.
We’ll continue building on this idea when we introduce convolution, which is just the response of a system to this kind of delta-based representation.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

This impulse response, shown here as h of n, is our key piece of knowledge.
I’m not asking you to start from nothing.I’m giving you the system’s reaction to a standardized input — the delta function applied at time zero.
Once you have that, you’re ready.
Because if I give the system a more general input — not just a single impulse, but any arbitrary shape —you can still figure out the output.
So the question becomes:How do you compute the output from this known impulse response and a general input?
That’s exactly where convolution comes in.

21,"In a shift-invariant system, if you know the system’s response to an impulse at one location, you can predict its response at any other location or time.
That’s because shift-invariance means the system behaves the same way, no matter where or when you apply the impulse.
If you apply an impulse at a different time or position, you can infer the output by simply shifting the known response accordingly.
And because the system is linear, you have additivity and homogeneity.
If you scale an input, the output will be scaled in the same way.
If you add multiple inputs, the output will be the sum of individual outputs due to each input.
This is exactly why knowing the impulse response of a system tells you everything about how that system behaves — no matter what input you give it.

To summarize, for a shift-invariant linear system, given any input, we want to compute the output.The critical information we rely on is the system’s impulse response.If we know how the system reacts to a delta function at time zero,we can use that as a building block to find the output for any input.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

22,"To be specific, now let’s see how we actually compute the output y of n of a shift-invariant linear system to an arbitrary input x of n, formulated on the 1st line.
Suppose I give you a system characterized by its impulse response, written as h of n, which is shown on the 2nd line.That means: if you feed the system a discrete delta function as input, the output will be h of n.This response — h of n — is the system’s character.
But what if you give the system a more general input, say x of n?What will the output y of n be, which is what I just formulated on the 1st line, and a very important question.
Let’s break it down step by step.
Since the system is shift-invariant, if you shift the input by k, the output also shifts by k, shown on the 3rd line.So if the input is delta of n minus k, the output becomes h of n minus k.
Then, because the system is linear, if we scale the input by x of k,Consequently, the output is also scaled by x of k.That gives us x of k times h of n minus k on the 4th line.
Now, to get the total output, we add up all of these scaled and shifted responses.
Mathematically, this gives us the convolution sum, on the right-hand side of the last two lines:
y of n equals the sum over k from minus infinity to infinity of x of k times h of n minus k.
This is how the convolution is defined, and also why we need this concept.
It shows why the impulse response is so powerful — it’s all you need to compute the system’s output for any input.
Now, convolution might seem a bit tricky at first, especially because of the flipping and shifting involved —that negative k inside h of n minus k could appear confusing.
But if you follow the logic step-by-step, the structure becomes clear.

23,"Now let’s apply the same idea in the continuous case.
Again, you’re given the system’s response to a delta function, which we call h of t.
If we shift the delta to t minus tau, the output becomes h of t minus tau.In other words, shifting the input shifts the output in the same way — that’s shift-invariance.
Next, we scale the input by x of tau.Because the system is linear, the output also gets scaled — giving us x of tau times h of t minus tau.
Finally, to build the full output for a general input signal,we integrate over all time — summing these scaled and shifted responses.
This gives us the continuous-time convolution integral:

You can think of this as collecting all the weighted impulse responses across time,and combining them to form the system’s output, where we have utilized the sampling property of the delta function.
This is how linear, shift-invariant systems behave in continuous time —and this operation, convolution, lies at the heart of modeling and understanding them.

25,"Let’s consider a hands-on example using two discrete functions, each with five data points.
Now imagine holding out both hands:your left hand represents one function — let’s call it x of n,and your right hand represents the other — this will be h of n, the impulse response.
Because of that negative k in the convolution sum,one function needs to be flipped — think of it like flipping your right hand so you see the back of it.That’s how we visualize h of n minus k.
Now we shift this flipped function across the input and calculate the output step-by-step.

For n equals zero, you align the flipped function with the origin,multiply the overlapping points, then sum the products —this gives you the output y of zero.

For n equals one, shift the flipped function one step to the right,multiply again, sum the result — and you get y of one.
You keep shifting, multiplying, and summing for each value of n.
You’ll notice that when the two functions fully overlap,you get the largest value in the convolution.And as they slide past each other, the overlap decreases,so the convolution value gradually falls back to zero.

27,"Let’s see another example — this time from medical imaging.
Imagine you’re injecting a contrast agent, like iodine, into the bloodstream to highlight blood vessels in an X-ray image.
Without contrast, the blood, vessels, and surrounding tissue can look very similar.But when you add contrast, the vessels light up more clearly, making them easier to detect and interpret.
Now here’s the key part: as the iodine travels through the body, it moves along multiple paths.
Some paths are fast — like major arteries. Others are slower — like capillaries or microvasculature.Each of these paths introduces a different delay before the contrast reaches the detector.
If you could inject an ideal, instantaneous impulse of contrast — in other words, a perfect delta function —then what you would see is a collection of impulse responses, labeled here as H 1, H 2, H 3, and so on.

Each of these responses corresponds to a different path, and each arrives at a different time.
But in reality, injections are not perfect impulses. They take time.
This means the actual contrast input is more spread out — and the measured output at the gamma camerabecomes a sum of all these delayed responses, weighted by how much contrast passes through each path.

In other words, the system’s output is a convolution of the injected input with the system’s impulse response.

29,"Now, let’s work through a more abstract — and slightly more mathematical — example.I like to call this a minds-on example.
This example is based on continuous convolution, and while it’s not difficult, it does require you to think like in calculus.
So let’s take our time with it.
With convolution, the basic process is this:We flip one function, shift it, multiply them point by point, and then integrate over the region where they overlap.
At first, that might sound a little mechanical. So let’s break it down clearly, step by step.
We’re working with two functions here:
f of t, shown in red. This is a triangular function — it starts at zero, rises to a peak at t equals 2, and then drops back to zero.
g of t, shown in purple. This is a rectangular pulse that spans from t equals minus 2 to plus 2, with a constant value of 3.
Now, because g of t is symmetric, flipping it across the vertical axis doesn’t change its shape —which actually makes our job easier.
So we’ll flip g to get g of t minus tau, and then slide it across f of tau,evaluating the convolution at each position t.
Here’s the key part:Both functions are compactly supported, meaning they’re only non-zero over a specific range.That means the overlap only happens during certain intervals.
So to compute the convolution, we’ll handle it case by case — based on the value of t.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
30,"👉 Case 1: When t is less than –2
At this stage, the flipped and shifted version of g, written as g of t minus tau,is positioned so far to the left that it does not overlap with f of tau at all.
That means the product of the two functions is zero everywhere,so the convolution result y of t is also zero.
This is our first insight:No overlap means no contribution to the integral, and the output is zero.


 Case 2: When t is between –2 and 0
Now we begin to see partial overlap.
As g of t minus tau slides to the right, part of it starts to enter the region where f of tau is non-zero.
Let’s break this down mathematically:
Over the region where they overlap, f of tau is defined asf of tau equals negative tau plus 2, valid from tau equals 0 to tau equals 2.
And the flipped rectangle, g of t minus tau, still has a constant height of 3 wherever it overlaps.
So we’re integrating the product of these two functions across the overlapping interval.

The simplifies convolution becomes:3 times the integral of (–tau + 2), from 0 to 2 plus t.
If you evaluate this integral, you get:y of t equals negative three-halves t squared plus 6.
So the convolution result in this case is a parabolic curve, rising as t approaches zero.

This illustrates an important idea:Convolution is constructed from slices of overlapping areas —and in each case, we’re summing the product over those intervals of overlap.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:

31,"Case 3: When t is between 0 and 2
In this case, the flipped and shifted version of g, that is, g of t minus tau,completely overlaps the triangular function f of tau.
This means we integrate across the entire support of f of tau,from tau equals 0 to 2.
Within this interval:
f of tau equals negative tau plus 2
g of t minus tau is constant at 3
So the convolution becomes:y of t equals the integral from 0 to 2 of 3 times (–tau + 2), d tau
When we evaluate this, we get:y of t equals 6
So, for t between 0 and 2, the convolution gives a flat region with a constant value of 6.This happens because the area under the product is the same across the entire interval.

 Case 4: When t is between 2 and 4
Now, f of tau begins to slide out of the rectangular window of g of t minus tau.
We’re back to a partial overlap, but this time on the opposite side —the right edge of g is moving past f.
The new overlapping interval runs fromtau equals t minus 2 to tau equals 2
Again, we use:
f of tau equals negative tau plus 2
g of t minus tau equals 3
So the convolution becomes:y of t equals the integral from t minus 2 to 2 of 3 times (–tau + 2), d tau
Evaluating this gives:y of t equals three-halves t squared minus twelve t plus 24
This result traces out the descending part of the convolution curve,as the overlap shrinks toward zero.

 Case 5: When t is greater than or equal to 4
At this point, g of t minus tau has completely moved past f of tau.
There is no overlap between the two functions,so the convolution result once again becomes:y of t equals 0",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

32,"Now, let’s bring all the cases together to write the full piecewise definition of the convolution result.
We’ve carefully stepped through five distinct intervals,each showing how the amount of overlap between f of t and g of t determines the value of the convolution.
Putting everything together, we now have the complete solution.

Each case — from full overlap, to partial overlap, to no overlap —contributes a segment of the final output.

This leads to a piecewise-defined function, expressed as follows:
y of t equals 0,          for t less than –2
y of t equals –three-halves t squared plus 6, for t between –2 and 0
y of t equals 6,             for t between 0 and 2
y of t equals three-halves t squared minus 12 t plus 24, for t between 2 and 4
y of t equals 0,          for t greater than or equal to 4
When we plot these expressions, we get a smooth, continuous curve —it rises, flattens out in the middle, and then gradually falls again.It forms a kind of bump, which is exactly what we expectas g of t slides over and past f of t.

Now here’s the key point:If we apply a delta function as the input — meaning a sharp, instantaneous impulse —the output is the circuit’s impulse response, denoted h of t.

The h of t of the RC circuit is a decaying exponential. It tells us how the circuit reacts over time after a sudden input.
But what happens if we apply a more general input — like a square pulse or a step function?
Well, just like we learned, we can decompose that input into a sum of small impulse components.Each tiny impulse generates a scaled copy of the impulse response, and the total output is the convolution of the input and h of t.

We can see this visually on the right:Different inputs — like short pulses or longer ones — are convolved with h of t,and the resulting output curves smoothly reflect how the circuit responds over time.

This is the system’s impulse response in two dimensions.
So even if your input is just a single point — like a star in the night sky —the output captured by your imaging system is a small, spread-out shape.

Deconvolution is the process of trying to undo that effect —to recover the original image from its blurred version.

On the left, we see convolution.Function f is in blue, and function g is in red.In convolution, g is first flipped horizontally, then shifted, multiplied with f, and finally integrated or summed.As g slides across f, the overlapping area is computed at each step — producing the black output curve below.
In the middle, we have cross-correlation.It follows the same steps as convolution, except there’s no flipping of g.We simply shift g across f, multiply at each point, and accumulate the result.So visually, the shapes are the same, but the symmetry is different — this matters in pattern alignment and signal comparison.
On the right, we see autocorrelation.This is a special case of cross-correlation where the same function is compared with itself.So g and f are the same, and we measure how well the signal matches its own shifted versions.The result usually peaks at zero shift — showing maximum similarity with itself — and falls off on either side.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

46,"Let’s take a look at how convolution helps with feature extraction — especially edge detection — which is fundamental in medical imaging and computer vision.
In this example, we’re applying a Sobel filter, often used to detect edges in the horizontal direction.
We begin with the source image, represented as a grid of pixel intensity values.The Sobel kernel, shown here as a 3-by-3 matrix, contains weights:negative one, zero, and positive one across columns — designed to emphasize horizontal changes.
Here’s what happens:We align the filter over a 3-by-3 region of the input image.Then, we compute the sum of products between the kernel weights and the underlying pixel values.

Join the lecture with the preview in mind and listen carefully.  Ask if you have questions proactively. Afterward, work through the homework and revisit the material again. This layered approach — reading, watching, listening, asking, practicing — really helps deepen your understanding.

Today, we’re going to explore a very powerful concept in signal processing: the Fourier series. This topic takes us a step beyond convolution, both in complexity and in importance. It’s a bit more challenging, but it’s absolutely central to many applications in engineering, physics, and medical imaging. So, I’ll do my best to break it down and highlight the key ideas so that you can follow along with confidence.

In some courses or textbooks, you might be handed a formula for Fourier analysis and told to apply it mechanically. And sure — you might be able to follow the steps, plug in numbers, and get the right answer. But that kind of approach often leaves you without a real understanding of what’s happening under the hood.

Here, we’re going to do things differently. Instead of just giving you the equations, we’ll take the time to explore the why and how behind them. What does the Fourier series represent? Why does it work? And how does it help us understand complex signals?

This deeper understanding is especially important in a field like medical imaging, where you’re not just solving math problems — you’re working with real-world data that affects real people. So, our goal is not just to teach you the tools, but to help you develop a solid intuition for how and why they work.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

3,"Now, let me share what I hope you'll take away from this lecture. We’re going to approach the Fourier series from a geometric perspective, starting with the idea of high-dimensional space. This means thinking about vectors, angles, distances, and inner products — not just in two or three dimensions, but in spaces with many dimensions.

When we combine all of these geometric tools, we begin to see Fourier series and Fourier transforms not as abstract formulas, but as structured transformations — transformations that have a clear geometric interpretation.

And that’s powerful. Because once you can visualize what’s going on, everything becomes more intuitive. You not only understand the formulas better, but you also remember them more easily. You know what each term is doing. You’re no longer just running code or solving equations without knowing why they work. You can see the big picture. In our last lecture, we talked about linear systems and their behavior in both continuous and discrete settings. 

We introduced convolution and briefly touched on concepts such as the inner product and cross-correlation. Some of you might have found those connections a bit abstract, and that’s completely normal at first. But today, we’ll start bringing those pieces together, using geometry as our guide.
Let’s dive in.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

4,"Let’s now talk about a foundational concept that underpins much of what we’re doing — the inner product, also known as the dot product.

Suppose you have two vectors, A and B. The inner product is calculated by pairing each element of vector A with the corresponding element of vector B, multiplying those pairs, and then summing the results.

In mathematical terms, if vector A has components A1 through An, and vector B has components B1 through Bn, then the inner product of A and B is the sum from i equals 1 to n of Ai times Bi.

Let’s look at an example. Take vector A as 1, 3, negative 5, and vector B as 4, negative 2, negative 1.

We compute the inner product as follows:One times four, plusthree times negative two, plusnegative five times negative one.
That gives us 4 minus 6 plus 5, which equals 3.

Now, why is this important? Because when we perform convolution or cross-correlation, we are essentially performing inner products — over and over again. Each time we slide one signal over another and compute the inner product, we generate one output value.
This is exactly how matched filtering works in radar systems. When an incoming signal — such as an echo from an aircraft — aligns with a known pattern, the inner product reaches its peak, making it possible to detect the target.

From the perspective of linear systems, cross-correlation involves flipping and shifting one signal, and then computing a whole series of inner products. The result becomes the output response of a shift-invariant system. So understanding inner products is not just helpful — it’s essential.

There’s also a beautiful geometric interpretation. The inner product of two vectors equals the product of their magnitudes multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them.

In other words, the dot product of A and B equals the norm of A times the norm of B times cosine theta — where theta is the angle between the two vectors.

So, if the vectors point in the same direction, the angle is zero, and cosine of zero is one — giving you the maximum value.
If the vectors are orthogonal — that is, they are at 90 degrees — then cosine theta is zero, and so is the inner product.

And here’s something really elegant: if you take the inner product of a vector with itself, you get the square of its length. That means the magnitude of a vector can be defined as the square root of its inner product with itself.

In summary, the inner product captures three things at once — length, angle, and alignment — all in a single operation. And that makes it the foundation for everything we’ll do with Fourier series.

Here’s another way to think about it — by drawing a biological analogy.

Think of the inner product like the base pairing in DNA. Just as DNA sequences are built from matched pairs of bases — adenine with thymine, guanine with cytosine — our inner product is built by matching one element from vector A with one from vector B. Each matched pair contributes to the total result.
And just like those base pairings carry the essential instructions for life, this mathematical pairing carries the structural foundation for data analysis. The overall sum of those matched pairs — the inner product — gives us meaningful information about the relationship between two datasets or signals.

In many ways, you can think of the inner product as the DNA of data science. It’s what lets us quantify similarity, compute distances, analyze angles, and perform transformations. We’ll keep coming back to this idea throughout the course, so keep it in mind as we go deeper into Fourier theory.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

5,"Let’s now revisit the concept of a shift-invariant linear system, which we introduced earlier in the course. This diagram gives us a step-by-step breakdown of how such systems behave — and how the inner product plays a central role.

Here’s the key idea: once you're given the impulse response of a system — that is, how it reacts to a single impulse — and you know the system is both linear and shift-invariant, then you can compute the system’s output for any input signal.
This is exactly where convolution comes into play.

As shown in the diagram, the input signal x of n can be represented as a weighted sum of shifted delta functions.That is, x of n equals the sum over k, from negative infinity to infinity, of x of k times delta of n minus k.

Now, for each of those shifted deltas — delta of n minus k — the system responds with a shifted impulse response:h of n minus k.
And this response is scaled by the input value at that shift, which is x of k.

So what do we do next?
We add up all those scaled responses. The result is:x of n equals the sum over k, from minus infinity to infinity, of x of k times h of n minus k.
That’s the standard convolution formula.

But here’s what’s really important:When you compute the convolution at a particular time n, you are essentially performing an inner product.
You take the input signal and the flipped, shifted impulse response — multiply them element by element — and sum the result.
This process is just like computing the dot product of two vectors.
This same concept is used in matched filtering — like in radar signal processing.
In this process, we take a known pattern — which we refer to as the filter — and slide it across the incoming signal.When the filter aligns well with a portion of the signal, the inner product reaches a maximum value.This peak indicates that a strong match has been detected.

Whether we call it convolution or cross-correlation, the operation always boils down to computing inner products.
So once again, the inner product isn’t just a nice-to-have mathematical idea.It is the fundamental engine behind convolution, filtering, correlation, and soon, our study of Fourier analysis.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

6,"Let’s now take a step back and look at the inner product from a geometric perspective. This viewpoint helps us build strong intuition, especially as we move into higher dimensions.

Start by imagining two-dimensional space. You have a vector A, which we can think of as a point in that space. Now, add another non-zero vector, let’s call it vector B. Along with the zero vector — that’s the origin — these two define a straight line. This line contains all the scalar multiples of vector B. In other words, the line L of k equals k times vector B, where k is any real number.

Now here’s the key idea: we want to project vector A onto that line. In other words, we want to find the point on the line that’s closest to vector A. Mathematically, this means finding the value of k that minimizes the distance between vector A and k times vector B.

The expression shown here represents that squared distance. It’s written as the sum, from i equals 1 to N, of the square of the quantity ai minus k times bi. That’s essentially the Euclidean distance, squared — but applied component-wise in vector form.

This is an extension of the classic distance formula you saw in high school geometry: the square root of x one minus x two squared, plus y one minus y two squared. But now, we’re doing it in higher dimensions.

To minimize the distance, we take the derivative of that squared distance with respect to k, set it to zero, and solve for k. When we do that, we arrive at this important formula:
k equals the inner product of vector A and vector B, divided by the squared norm of vector B.
That gives us the scaling factor for the projection.And then, the distance from the origin to the projected point is:
D equals A dot B, divided by the norm of B.
This leads us back to a central identity in geometry:
A dot B equals the length of A times the length of B times the cosine of theta, where theta is the angle between the two vectors.
So what does this all mean geometrically?

The inner product tells us how much of vector A lies in the direction of vector B.It’s the projection of A onto B, scaled by how aligned the two are — and that alignment is captured by the cosine of the angle.
If A and B are orthogonal — that means they’re at a ninety-degree angle — then the cosine is zero, and so is the inner product.But if they point in the same direction, the cosine is one, and the projection is at its maximum.

So this isn’t just an abstract formula. It gives us a powerful visual interpretation of what the inner product is really doing — measuring alignment.
And this interpretation extends naturally into higher dimensions, which makes it especially useful as we transition into Fourier series.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

7,"Let’s now turn our attention to a very important and elegant result in linear algebra and geometry — the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.

If you haven’t yet walked through the proof of this inequality, I encourage you to do so. It’s not just a theoretical result — it’s a tool that offers deep insight into how vectors relate to each other.

Now, the inequality is written here in both summation and vector form.
You can see here.

In vector form, we write:The absolute value of a dot b is less than or equal to the norm of a times the norm of b.

In plain terms, if you take the dot product of two vectors, its value will always be smaller than or equal to the product of their magnitudes.
Equality holds only when one vector is a scalar multiple of the other — in other words, when the vectors are perfectly aligned.

To make this more concrete, let’s consider the two-dimensional version:The quantity a squared plus b squared, multiplied by c squared plus d squared, is greater than or equal to the square of a times c plus b times d.

This is a specific case of the inequality and shows how it works with actual vector components.
Now, how do we prove it?

A typical approach involves setting up a quadratic expression that includes both vectors and a variable, x.We write the sum over i of the square of the quantity aᵢ times x plus bᵢ.This can also be written as the sum of aᵢ squared, multiplied by the square of x plus bᵢ divided by aᵢ
We set this whole expression equal to zero and solve the resulting quadratic equation.
This works because the square of a real quantity is always non-negative, so the sum equals zero only when all terms vanish.That only happens when the vectors are linearly dependent — and that’s what gives us the equality condition.
Now, let’s connect this back to geometry. Remember from the last slide, the inner product of two vectors equals the product of their magnitudes times the cosine of the angle between them.
That is:A dot B equals the norm of A times the norm of B times cosine theta.
Since cosine of theta is always between negative one and one, the dot product can never exceed the product of the magnitudes.That’s the geometric heart of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.

So this isn’t just an algebraic result — it’s a powerful guarantee about how closely two vectors can align.
And as we move into Fourier analysis, this principle plays a crucial role in how we represent signals, enforce orthogonality, and ensure numerical stability.
So keep this inequality in mind — we’ll revisit it again when we start working with basis functions and Fourier coefficients.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

8,"Let’s now return to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, but this time through a more intuitive, geometric lens.
Earlier, we explored the algebraic version. Now, let’s visualize what it really means. 

Imagine two vectors, A and B, drawn as arrows in space. The inner product between them — also called the dot product — can be expressed as:
A dot B equals norm of A times norm of B times cosine of the angle theta between them.
Now, keep in mind: cosine theta is always between minus one and plus one. So unless theta is exactly zero degrees — which means the vectors are pointing in the exact same direction — the inner product is always strictly less than the product of the magnitudes. That’s why the inequality holds.
But what about equality? 

Well, equality happens when cosine theta is equal to one. In other words, when theta equals zero. Geometrically, that means vector A lies perfectly along the line defined by vector B. One vector is simply a scaled version of the other.

In mathematical terms, we say:bi divided by ai equals c, for all values of i.
This means each component of B is a constant multiple of the corresponding component of A.
That constant, c, tells us how much we stretch or shrink vector A to get to vector B. When that relationship holds for every component, the two vectors are not only aligned — they are perfectly aligned, differing only in length.
This concept is extremely useful in signal processing. Take matched filtering, for example. Imagine you transmit a radar pulse. That pulse travels, reflects off an object — say, an airplane — and comes back. Because of factors like distance or material type, the return signal may be delayed or weakened, but its shape stays the same.

So how do we detect it?
We use cross-correlation. That means we slide the known signal over the incoming data and measure how similar they are. When the alignment is strongest — that is, when the cross-correlation reaches its peak — the two signals are most similar in shape.
This is where the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality comes in. When two signals align perfectly, their inner product is maximized. Cosine theta approaches one. That tells us: these vectors — or signals — are almost perfectly matched.

So this triangle diagram isn't just a piece of geometry. It’s a powerful mental image that shows how the inner product captures alignment. And equality — the case when the inequality becomes an equality — only happens when vectors point exactly in the same direction. Whether you're in two dimensions, three dimensions, or even much higher-dimensional space — the story remains the same.
That’s the geometric heart of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

9,"Now let’s take everything we’ve learned so far and generalize it to n-dimensional space — what we call “R n,” or more formally, R superscript n.
Suppose we have two vectors:Vector V has components v i,and vector W has components w i.

These indices — the little i — run from 1 to n, where n is the number of dimensions.So V and W are points in high-dimensional space.But just like in two or three dimensions, we can still calculate the distance between them.

That distance is given by this formula:D squared of V and W equals the sum over i of v i minus w i, squared.
This is just a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem.
In two dimensions, it gives the diagonal of a square.In three dimensions, it gives the diagonal of a cube.In n dimensions, it gives the straight-line — or Euclidean — distance between two points.

Next, let’s talk about projection — projecting one vector onto the line defined by the other.For instance, we can project vector V onto the direction of vector W.To do this, we find the scalar value k that minimizes the distance between V and the scaled version of W.
Mathematically, that means minimizing the squared distance —the sum over i of v i minus k times w i, squared.

The optimal value of k — the one that minimizes that distance — is given by:k equals V dot W, over the norm of W squared.
This result comes directly from taking the derivative of the squared distance with respect to k,setting it equal to zero, and solving.And look what appears naturally in the formula: the dot product, or inner product.So this isn’t a random definition — it’s rooted in geometry.
That brings us to another essential concept: angle and orthogonality.

We can also express the inner product as:V dot W equals norm of V times norm of W times cosine theta —where theta is the angle between the two vectors.
So when theta equals 90 degrees, cosine theta is zero, and the inner product is zero.That’s the condition for orthogonality — when vectors are perpendicular.

Even in R n — in any number of dimensions — the inner product continues to define distance, projection, angle, and orthogonality.These aren’t just abstract mathematical ideas.They are the foundation for understanding how high-dimensional geometry works.And they’re essential tools in areas like signal analysis, data science, and machine learning.
Finally, don’t forget about basis and dimensionality.
In two dimensions, you need two basis vectors — usually along the x and y axes.In n-dimensional space, you need n basis vectors to describe any direction or position fully.

10,"Now let’s focus on a familiar and intuitive case — three-dimensional space.This diagram provides a clear geometric visualization that many of you have likely encountered before.
We’re looking at a vector — let’s call it vector A — situated in three-dimensional space.You can think of vector A as an arrow pointing from the origin to some point in space.
Alternatively, you can think of it simply as a collection of coordinates.
Either way, vector A is completely described by its three components —x A, y A, and z A —which correspond to its projections along the x, y, and z axes.

Now, here’s the key idea:Each of these components represents how much vector A ""points"" in the direction of one of the coordinate axes.
If you project vector A onto the x-axis, you get x A.Project it onto the y-axis, and you get y A.Project it onto the z-axis, and you get z A.
This method of description is based on an orthogonal basis,which simply means the axes are all perpendicular to each other —at right angles.
And here’s the important part:If you know x A, y A, and z A,you have everything you need to reconstruct the entire vector A.
That’s because vector A is just the sum of its three projections —each one scaled by a unit vector in the x, y, or z direction.

Mathematically, we write:vector A equalsx A times i-hat,plus y A times j-hat,plus z A times k-hat.
Here, i-hat is the unit vector along the x-axis,j-hat is the unit vector along the y-axis,and k-hat is the unit vector along the z-axis.
This idea generalizes beautifully to higher dimensions.Instead of working with x, y, and z,you’ll have more axes — more basis directions —but the principle stays the same.
And here’s where this becomes really exciting:
In Fourier analysis, we do something very similar,but instead of projecting onto spatial axes,we project onto a set of basis functions —like sine and cosine waves.
So, what you’re seeing here in 3Dis not just about vectors in space.It’s the same foundational idea that lets usanalyze and reconstruct complex signalsin the frequency domain.

11,"Previously, we saw how a vector in three-dimensional space can be represented using its projections onto the x, y, and z axes. Now, let’s extend this same idea to n-dimensional space — using orthogonal basis vectors to represent any arbitrary vector.
Let’s quickly review the 3D case first.We have three standard unit vectors: along the x-axis, e x equals the vector 1, 0, 0, along the y-axis, e y equals 0, 1, 0, and along the z-axis, e z equals 0, 0, 1.Any 3D vector — let’s say vector v — with components x, y, and z, can be written as a weighted sum of these basis vectors.So, we write: vector v equals v dot e x times e x, plus v dot e y times e y, plus v dot e z times e z.Each of these terms represents the projection of vector v onto one of the coordinate directions. Because our basis vectors are orthogonal and of unit length, we don’t need to normalize — the inner product directly gives us the component in that direction.

Now let’s generalize to n dimensions.Suppose we have a vector — we’ll call it vector W — that lives in n-dimensional space. We can express this vector as a linear combination of n orthonormal basis vectors, denoted as e n, where n runs from 1 to capital N.The formula looks like this: vector W equals the sum from n equals 1 to capital N of W dot e n times e n.

In words, for each basis direction e n, we project W onto that direction by computing the inner product W dot e n. That gives us the scalar coefficient for that direction. Then we scale e n by that coefficient and sum everything together.
This is a very powerful idea: you can express any vector — no matter how high the dimension — as a sum of projections onto orthonormal basis vectors.And what’s even more powerful is that those basis vectors don’t have to be just the standard coordinate axes.They could be sine and cosine functions, as we use in Fourier series. Or they could be eigenvectors in principal component analysis. Or wavelets, or anything else — as long as they are orthonormal.So what we’ve described on this slide is the general framework of orthogonal representation in n-dimensional space.

12,"Now here’s a very important point — and one that’s often overlooked.A basis is not unique.

Let’s begin with a simple analogy in two-dimensional space.In most problems, we use the standard coordinate system — with one unit vector along the x-axis and one along the y-axis.In that system, the basis vectors are: 1, 0 for the x-direction, and 0, 1 for the y-direction.
But now imagine we rotate the coordinate system by some angle — let’s call it phi.
After this rotation, we have a new set of axes — shown in red on the diagram.These new axes define a new basis, one that’s rotated by the angle phi.And here’s the key: this rotated basis is just as valid as the original one.
Every point in the plane can still be represented using the new basis.The point hasn’t moved — only the coordinate system has changed.So the coordinates of the point relative to the new axes will be different, but the underlying geometry is the same.
Mathematically, the new coordinates, which we’ll call x-prime and y-prime, are computed from the original coordinates x and y using this rotation:x-prime equals x times cosine phi, plus y times sine phi.y-prime equals negative x times sine phi, plus y times cosine phi.

In matrix form, this looks like:opcosine phi, sine phi; negative sine phi, cosine phi,
This is a classic rotation matrix — it rotates vectors by an angle phi in the plane.
And this concept generalizes beautifully.In three dimensions, you can rotate about the x-axis, the y-axis, or the z-axis, producing new orthogonal bases in each case.You can also use combinations of these rotations — just like the lower diagram shows — rotating around alpha, beta, and gamma angles.
And in n-dimensional space, the same principle applies.
So what’s the takeaway?The basis you choose to describe vectors is not fixed.You can rotate it, change it, or switch to one that better fits the problem.This is especially useful in Fourier analysis, where we don’t just rotate axes — we build entirely new bases, like sine and cosine functions, to describe signals more effectively.
So while the geometry remains unchanged, the coordinate description of a point — or a signal — depends on the basis you choose.That’s the power of flexible, non-unique bases in linear algebra and signal processing.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

Now, the inner product of these two vectors is written as:v dot w equals v1 times w1, plus v2 times w2, plus all the way up to vn times wn.

This formula isn’t arbitrary. It’s grounded in both geometric intuition and practical applications — including signal detection and system analysis. But geometrically, it gives us the clearest picture of how vectors interact.
For example, if we take the inner product of a vector with itself, we get: v dot v equals the sum of the squares of its components. That is: v1 squared plus v2 squared, and so on, up to vn squared. Which is simply the squared length of the vector — or the norm squared. 

So we write: v dot v equals double bar v double bar squared.
This gives us the magnitude of a vector, which is fundamental to defining distance, angle, and orthogonality — even in very high-dimensional spaces.
Now, let’s talk about basis.In R-n, we use what’s called the natural basis. These are vectors of length one that point along each coordinate direction.So we define:e1 as 1, 0, 0, and so on,e2 as 0, 1, 0, and so on,and so on, up to en, which is 0, 0, and finally 1.

Each of these vectors is orthogonal to the others, meaning their inner product is zero unless you're comparing a vector with itself.
So any vector v can be written as a linear combination of these basis vectors. That is: v equals v1 times e1, plus v2 times e2, all the way up to vn times en.
And how do we get each of these coefficients?
Simple — by taking the inner product of v with the corresponding basis vector. So we say: v dot ek equals vk.
This structure — combining orthogonality, projection, and basis expansion — gives us a clean and consistent framework for working with any dimensional space. Whether we’re dealing with 3D vectors in physics, or a hundred-dimensional space in data analysis, the math works the same way.
And beneath it all is a visual, geometric idea: projecting, aligning, and reconstructing using components along axes.That’s the foundation of vector spaces.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

14,"Let’s close this section with a powerful and elegant idea — something that ties everything we’ve learned so far into a single, intuitive picture.Every vector is a point.That’s right — a vector isn’t just a list of numbers. It represents a location in space.

For example, in two-dimensional space, a vector with components x and y — written as x, y — can be seen as a point on the plane.If this vector has unit length — meaning its magnitude is one — then it lies on the unit circle.As you move around that circle, each position corresponds to a different vector, but all with the same length.
Now in three dimensions, the same idea holds.A unit-length vector becomes a point on the surface of a unit sphere.Again, the magnitude is one, but the direction can vary.And every point on the sphere represents a different vector of unit length.
This concept scales beautifully to higher dimensions.
In general, if we’re in n-dimensional space, the collection of all vectors of the same length — say, length r — forms an n-sphere.
Mathematically, we write this as: S n equals open curly brace x in R n plus 1, such that double bar x double bar equals r close curly brace.
This simply means: we’re gathering all the vectors that are at a fixed distance r from the origin.Each of these vectors is also a point in space.They all have the same magnitude — r — but different directions.
So geometrically, a vector is just a point, and when we fix the length of these vectors, they trace out meaningful shapes like circles in 2D, spheres in 3D, or hyperspheres in higher dimensions.

This perspective becomes especially important as we move forward into signal processing and functional spaces, where even functions can be treated like vectors — and those vectors live in infinite-dimensional spaces.
But the core idea doesn’t change.A vector is a point. A point is a vector.And the same geometry that applies to physical space applies to abstract spaces as well — including the ones we’ll encounter next in our study of Fourier series.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

15,"Let’s now take the next big step in our journey —a function can actually be treated like a vector.

Now, when you first think about a function — for example, y equals f of x —You can imagine a smooth curve on a graph.As x changes, you get a continuous stream of y-values,and these values trace out a flowing shape across the domain.
That’s the classical view — a function as a curve.
But here’s a shift in perspective that changes everything.
Suppose you discretize the function.That means instead of considering every possible x,you just pick a few specific values:x 1, x 2, all the way to x n.
At each of these points, you compute the function:f of x 1, f of x 2, and so on, up to f of x n.
And now you have a finite list of numbers.Those function values — can be written as a vector.Each value becomes one component of that vector.

In the diagram here, you see a red curve — that’s the original function —and below it, green bars showing sample values.If we sample the function at 7 locations,we can think of those 7 values as a 7-dimensional vector.
Take more samples — say 700, or 7 million —and the dimension of the vector simply increases.But conceptually, it’s still just a point in some high-dimensional space.

So here’s the key idea:a function is just a vector — possibly a very high-dimensional one.And that means we can apply all the tools of vector analysis to functions.We can talk about the length of a function,we can project one function onto another,and we can compute angles between functions,just like we did with ordinary vectors in R-n.
This insight is exactly what powers Fourier analysis.In a Fourier series, we project a function onto a set of orthogonal basis functions —functions like sine and cosine —just as we projected ordinary vectors onto coordinate axes.

So let me leave you with this big takeaway:
If a vector is a point,and a function is a vector,then a function is also a point —a point living in a high-dimensional function space.
That’s the foundation of what we’ll build next —representing and analyzing functions using the powerful language of vectors.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

16,"We’ve talked a lot about vectors — and how to compute their inner productby multiplying corresponding components and then adding them up.That’s the basic operation in vector space.

Mathematically, for vectors A and B, the inner product is written as:A dot B equals the sum from i equals minus infinity to infinityof a i times b i.

Now, let’s extend this idea to functions.In functional space, instead of dealing with discrete components,we’re dealing with continuous values defined over time or space.
So, instead of a summation, we use an integral.The inner product of two functions, A of t and B of t, is defined as the integral from minus infinity to infinityof A of t times B of t, d t.
That’s our functional equivalent of the vector dot product.The interpretation is exactly the same:we’re measuring how much two signals align —whether they point in similar directions in an infinite-dimensional space.

Now here comes the big question:Can we find a basis for functions, just like we do in vector spaces?
And the answer is yes.One powerful basis uses something called the Dirac delta function —written as delta of x minus a.

Let me explain.
There’s a key identity in signal processing that says:f of t equals the integral from minus infinity to infinityof delta of tau minus t, times f of tau, d tau.

What does this mean?
Well, the delta function is like a mathematical spike —It’s zero everywhere, except at a single point.So when we multiply f of tau by delta of tau minus t,We’re isolating the value of f right at tau equals t.And by integrating over all tau, we’re reconstructing the full functionby sweeping this spike across the domain.
Think of it this way:each delta function — centered at a point a —acts like a basis vector.And each one is scaled by f of a —the value of the function at that location.
This is just like saying:v equals v one times e one plus v two times e two, and so on.
So yes, even in this continuous, infinite-dimensional space,we’re still using the same principle:Basis functions times coefficients gives you the full object.
And this paves the way for what’s coming next —Fourier series, where instead of spikes,we’ll use smooth, oscillating waves as our basis functions.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

17,"Let’s now revisit a powerful concept —representing a function as a sum of impulses.
Here’s the idea:Instead of describing a function as one smooth continuous curve,we break it down into a series of impulses, or spikes.
Each impulse is a shifted delta function —meaning, a very narrow spike placed at a specific time location.
We scale each spike by the height of the function at that point.In other words, the amplitude of the spike equals the value of f of tat that specific time t.
So we’re essentially saying:f of t equals the sum of delta functions,each multiplied by f at that location.

Look at the diagram.The smooth gray curve represents the original function,and the red arrows show the delta spikes.Each spike points straight up, and its heightmatches the value of the function at that moment.

Now, if you add all of these weighted impulses together —you recover the entire shape of the original function.
This construction gives us a complete basis in one dimension.And we can take this idea further.
In two dimensions, we use impulses defined over x and y.Think of image pixels — each pixel acts like a 2D delta function,placed at a specific location and scaled by intensity.
In three dimensions — like with medical images or 3D scans —we build the signal from tiny volume elements, or voxels.Each voxel is just an impulse located at some point in 3D space,scaled by the value of the function there.

So no matter the dimensionality —one D, two D, or three D —you can think of a signal, image, or volumeas being built from a grid of impulses.
Each impulse contributes a small piece of the whole.And together, they form the complete function.
That’s the power of thinking in terms of delta functions —they give us a clean, mathematical way to build upany function from the ground up, piece by piece.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

18,"This impulse-based thinking becomes especially useful when we move into the world of digital imaging.
When you capture a picture, what you really get is a grid of pixels — discrete samples of brightness or intensity at specific locations. Each pixel can be thought of as a weighted impulse. A brighter pixel contributes more to the image, a darker pixel contributes less. And when the pixel size gets smaller and smaller — approaching zero — you begin to approach the continuous version: the delta function.

So in this view, an entire image is just a sum of impulses, one per pixel, weighted by intensity.
And this isn’t limited to 2D images.

In 3D medical imaging, for example, we deal with voxels — volume elements — which are essentially 3D pixels. Again, each voxel corresponds to an impulse in space.
Whether it’s a 1D signal, a 2D image, or a 3D volume, we can represent the data using impulse-like basis functions. That’s one perspective.

19,"Sine and cosine waves show up everywhere in nature —and there's a beautiful reason for that.They arise naturally from circular motion.
Let’s take a simple example.
Imagine a point moving in a perfect circle —like the moon orbiting the Earth at constant speed.

Now, if you shine a light on that motionand watch the shadow it casts onto a flat surface —say, the x-axis —what do you get?
You get a sine wave.
That’s right —as the point moves around the circle,its horizontal position follows a smooth wave.That’s sine.
And if you project onto the y-axis instead,you get a cosine wave.

So these waveforms — sine and cosine —are really just the shadows of circular motion.
That’s a profound idea.
It tells us that sine and cosine functionsaren’t just mathematical inventions —they’re embedded in the geometry and physics of the real world.
They describe how things rotate, how waves travel,how springs vibrate, how light and sound move.
And because of this,sine and cosine waves form the foundation of somethingwe’ll explore in depth — the Fourier series.

So far, we’ve seen two major ways to represent functions:
First, as a sum of impulses —like tiny samples or pixel points in space.
And now, as a sum of sinusoids —waves that capture how a signal behaves across frequencies.
Both perspectives are incredibly powerful.They help us describe, analyze, and reconstruct datain ways that are both mathematically precise and physically meaningful.

20,"Let’s now take a closer look at the sinusoidal basis — especially the sine and cosine functions.

In the plot, the red curve represents the sine of x — written as sine x — and the green curve shows the cosine of x.
There’s a key difference in their symmetry. Cosine is an even function. That means if you reflect it across the vertical axis — the y-axis — it stays the same. In other words, the cosine of negative x equals the cosine of x.

Sine, on the other hand, is an odd function. That means it’s symmetric about the origin. So the sine of negative x equals the negative sine of x.
But here’s something subtle. Whether a function is “even” or “odd” actually depends on where you place the origin. If you shift your coordinate system, the symmetry can change. So this classification is based on our point of view — not an absolute property of the function.

Now here’s the deeper idea: sine and cosine functions together form an orthogonal basis. That means you can use them to represent any reasonable function — just like we previously used delta functions or unit vectors.
This sets the stage for a powerful idea: instead of expressing a function as a sum of impulses, like a series of spikes, we can express it as a sum of waves — smooth, continuous, sinusoidal components.

21,"This representation makes that idea visual and intuitive.

Here, each person is holding a different sine wave — each wave has a different frequency or amplitude. When we add these waves together, we get a more complex waveform — something that might look jagged, or smooth, or anything in between.

And this is the foundation of the Fourier series. It tells us that any reasonable function — smooth or sharp — can be represented as a weighted sum of sine and cosine waves. These sinusoidal components differ in frequency, phase, and amplitude. But together, they can recreate signals of almost any shape.

So, just like we saw earlier that a function could be built from impulses, here we’re seeing that a function can also be built from waves. These are two complementary viewpoints — both valid, both powerful.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

22,"Let’s now bring this idea to life with a demonstration.

What you’re seeing here is called spectral synthesis — it’s the process of reconstructing a function by adding together sine and cosine waves.
The red curve represents the signal or shape we want to recreate. Under the hood, we’re combining multiple sinusoidal components — each one a wave with its own frequency and amplitude.
As we begin, the approximation looks rough. But as we add more and more sine and cosine terms — especially ones with higher frequencies — the red curve starts to take shape. We can even mimic sharp edges or jumps, like you see in square waves, just by stacking enough high-frequency components together.
Here’s what’s important: each sine or cosine wave contributes a specific amount to the final signal. That amount is determined by its amplitude. If we were to graph those contributions — with frequency on the x-axis and amplitude on the y-axis — we’d get what’s known as the Fourier spectrum.

Think of it as the signal’s fingerprint. It tells us exactly how much of each frequency is present in the original function.

This is the core idea behind one-dimensional Fourier analysis. But it doesn’t stop there. We can extend the same concept to two-dimensional signals, like images — and even to three dimensions, when we’re working with volumes.
So what begins as a sum of simple waves turns out to be a powerful way of analyzing and reconstructing complex signals in any dimension.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

23,"Let’s now see what happens when we take everything we’ve learned and apply it to two-dimensional signals — like images.

Here we have a famous example — a grayscale portrait of Albert Einstein. At first glance, it seems complex and highly detailed. But if we perform 2D Fourier analysis, something remarkable happens: we can decompose this image into a collection of smooth, sinusoidal wave patterns.

In the middle panel, you see the amplitude spectrum — this tells us how much of each frequency is present in the image. Frequencies closer to the center are low — representing broad, smooth changes. As you move outward, the frequencies get higher — capturing fine details and edges.
On the right, you see an example of one such component: a 2D sinusoidal wave. These are like ripples in water, traveling in various directions — horizontal, vertical, diagonal — and at different frequencies.

Now if we zoom out, we can think of an image as a sum of many such 2D waves. That’s what the grid of small tiles on the bottom left represents — each one is a different sinusoidal basis function. Some capture coarse patterns; others capture fine textures.
As we adjust the amplitudes and phases of these sinusoidal components just right — and add them all together — we reconstruct the original image.
This is the essence of Fourier analysis in two dimensions:
We take a complex image, and represent it using simple, smooth building blocks. The result is a completely new way to think about images — not as pixels, but as combinations of spatial frequencies.

24,"Let’s take a moment to reflect on something deeper — a principle that reaches beyond signal processing and touches the foundations of physics and information itself.

In physics, we talk about the wave-particle duality — the idea that entities like photons and electrons exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior. Depending on how you observe them, they might act like tiny particles... or spread out like waves.
Interestingly, we see a similar duality in information science.

On one side, we have the particle view: information as discrete units — like pixels in an image, impulses in a signal, or delta functions in a mathematical model. This is the pixel-by-pixel, sample-by-sample perspective. It's granular and local.
On the other side, we have the wave view: information described in terms of global, smooth, continuous oscillations — sinusoidal waves of varying frequency, amplitude, and phase. This perspective captures structure across space or time — the big picture.

So when we represent a function — or an image, or a signal — we can choose either perspective.
Using delta functions or impulses, we build the signal by assembling localized pieces — one sharp component at a time.
Using sinusoidal functions, we build it using smooth, periodic waveforms that span the domain.
Both approaches are valid. In fact, they are mathematically equivalent when used with the right basis. 
And this is the central idea of today’s lecture:
A function can be viewed as a vector in a high-dimensional space — and depending on our basis, we can represent that function in many different ways.
You can think of a delta basis: where each basis function is an impulse at a specific location.
Or a sinusoidal basis: where each basis function is a sine or cosine wave with a different frequency.
These are just two different coordinate systems for the same space — and by projecting the function onto the basis elements, we retrieve coefficients that let us reconstruct the original signal as a linear combination.

So in summary:The delta basis gives us a particle-like view.The sinusoidal basis gives us a wave-like view.And both help us understand information from complementary perspectives.

This concludes the first part of our discussion — building intuition through geometry and representation.
In the second half, we’ll go deeper into Fourier series, where we work with periodic functions, and learn how to express them precisely in terms of sine and cosine components. We’ll take a short break now — about ten minutes — and then dive right into the math.
See you shortly.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

25,"Let’s now begin our exploration of Fourier series by focusing on a special class of functions: periodic functions.
A periodic function is one that repeats itself over and over again at regular intervals. Formally, we say that a function f of x is periodic if there exists a value — which we call the period, and usually denote with capital P — such that:
f of x plus P equals f of x, for all values of x.
This repeating behavior is what allows us to use the Fourier series to represent such functions.
Take a look at the top plot in this slide. It shows a one-dimensional example of a periodic function. It doesn't need to be a perfect sine or cosine wave — the key idea is that it repeats exactly after a fixed horizontal interval. In this case, that interval is P units.

Now look at the image below it. That’s a real-world example — a two-dimensional periodic pattern. Patterns like this are common in materials science, digital imaging, or even textures. You can see how the structure repeats itself in both the horizontal and vertical directions — that’s spatial periodicity in two dimensions.
So what is our goal?

We want to understand how any periodic function — no matter how smooth, jagged, or irregular — can be represented as a sum of sine and cosine waves.
This is the heart of the Fourier series. Even if a function looks complicated, we can rebuild it precisely by combining a collection of smooth sinusoidal waves — each with its own frequency, amplitude, and phase.

And here’s the beautiful part:If we get just one period of the function right, the rest of the function falls into place, because it's simply repetition.
So moving forward, we’ll first focus on periodic functions in one dimension. We’ll go through the math, develop the intuition, and build the full Fourier series representation. Then, once we understand that, we’ll extend the same ideas to two-dimensional cases, and even three dimensions — which is especially useful for signals, images, and medical data.

26,"Now let’s take the next step and define the Fourier series more precisely.

To keep things simple — and without losing any generality — we’ll start with a function defined over the interval from 0 to 1. We call this the unit period. The key assumption here is that the function repeats every unit interval. So if we understand what the function does between 0 and 1, we automatically understand it from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and even from negative 1 to 0.

Later, we’ll generalize to other periods — like from 0 to capital T, or from negative T over 2 to positive T over 2. But for now, let’s build our intuition using this simpler interval.

So, what kinds of functions are we considering here?
We’re working with real-valued functions that are square-integrable — that means when you square the function and integrate it over the interval from 0 to 1, the result is finite. If that integral blows up to infinity, the function is too wild, and we can’t represent it with a Fourier series. But if it’s finite, then the function behaves well enough for our purposes.

Mathematically, we say such functions belong to the space L square of zero to one — that’s the set of square-integrable functions over the interval from 0 to 1. This is a Hilbert space, meaning we can treat functions like vectors in an infinite-dimensional space.
And just like vectors have a basis, functions in this space also have an orthonormal basis.
What does that basis look like?

It turns out the basis consists of the constant function 1, plus an infinite family of sine and cosine functions:
Square root of 2 times cosine of 2 pi n t
Square root of 2 times sine of 2 pi n tfor n equals 1, 2, 3, and so on.
The factor of square root 2 ensures that each function has unit length — meaning, its inner product with itself equals 1. That’s what makes the basis orthonormal.

So here’s the big idea:
Any square-integrable function over the interval 0 to 1 can be expressed as a sum of these basis functions.And this sum is called the Fourier series.
Mathematically, we write:
f of t equals a naught over two,plus the summation over n of a n times cosine of 2 pi n t,plus the summation over n of b n times sine of 2 pi n t.

So, what do all these parts mean?
First, a naught is called the DC component. It represents the average value of the function over one period.
The a n coefficients are multiplied by cosine terms. These describe the even, symmetric parts of the function.
And the b n coefficients go with the sine terms. They capture the odd, asymmetric parts of the function.
In essence, what we’re doing is splitting the function into symmetrical and asymmetrical patterns, using sines and cosines as building blocks. This is what makes the Fourier series so elegant — it expresses any periodic function as a mix of smooth, familiar waveforms.

Now, each of these coefficients can be computed using inner products, which we'll define using integrals in the next slide.
But conceptually, this is just like decomposing a vector into components — except now we're working with continuous functions in an infinite-dimensional space, using smooth sine and cosine waves as our basis.
And that’s the beauty of the Fourier series:Rather than reconstructing a function using spikes or samples, we rebuild it by layering together simple waveforms.
This is the core principle of Fourier analysis:Break down the complex using the simple.Use a family of smooth waves to represent arbitrary structure.
Next, let’s see how to actually compute those coefficients.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

27,"Let’s now take a closer look at something we claimed earlier — that the set of sine and cosine functions, together with the constant function, form what we call an orthonormal basis.

Now, this idea might sound a bit abstract at first. But if we break it down, it’s very intuitive.
In the world of regular vectors — say, in two or three dimensions — we say vectors are orthogonal if they’re at right angles to each other. And if each one also has a length of one, we call them orthonormal.
The same idea applies in function space. But instead of using a dot product like we do for regular vectors, we use something called an inner product — which is defined using an integral. This inner product helps us measure both length and angle between functions.

Let’s walk through the specific relationships shown here.
First, the constant function — just the number one — has unit length. That means if we take its inner product with itself, we get one. So it’s normalized.
Now let’s see what happens when we compare the constant function with a cosine or a sine function. If we take the inner product of the constant with cosine of two pi times n times t, we get zero — for any positive integer n. The same is true for sine.

Why does this happen? Well, cosine and sine both oscillate above and below the horizontal axis, and over a full cycle, the positive and negative areas cancel out. So when you compare either of them with the constant, the result is zero — meaning they’re orthogonal.

Next, let’s compare sine and cosine functions with each other. Say, cosine of two pi times m times t and sine of two pi times n times t. Regardless of which frequencies m and n we choose, their inner product is zero. So sine and cosine are always orthogonal to each other.

Now here’s where it gets a bit more subtle.
If we compare cosine functions with other cosine functions — or sine with sine — the result depends on the frequencies.
If the frequencies are different, meaning m is not equal to n, the inner product is zero. They’re orthogonal.
But if the frequencies match — so m equals n — the inner product is one-half. That means the functions are not quite unit-length yet. They’re orthogonal but not normalized.

To fix that, we just scale the sine and cosine functions by the square root of two. Then, their inner product with themselves becomes exactly one, making the whole set orthonormal.
So here’s the big picture: we now have a set of functions — the constant, sine waves, and cosine waves — that are all mutually perpendicular and have unit length. Together, they form a complete orthonormal basis.

And once we have this basis, we can represent any periodic function as a combination of these building blocks. That combination is what we call the Fourier series, and the weights we use — the Fourier coefficients — tell us how much of each wave is present in the function.
Next, we’ll explore how to actually compute those coefficients using integrals.

28,"Before that, let’s talk about harmonics — a term you’ve probably heard in music, physics, or signal processing. In the context of Fourier series, harmonics refer to these beautifully smooth sinusoidal components, each oscillating at a different frequency.
Let’s unpack that.

The red curve you see here is the first harmonic, or the fundamental frequency. It completes exactly one full oscillation over the interval from 0 to 1. This is what we call the n equals 1 term in the Fourier series.
Now move down to the blue curve — that’s the second harmonic, where n equals 2. It oscillates twice as fast — so you get two full cycles in the same interval.
Then the green one, with n equals 3, completes three full oscillations, and so on. As you move further down the harmonic ladder — to n equals 4, n equal 5, and beyond — the frequency keeps increasing, and the wave becomes more and more tightly packed.

This is the key idea behind the Fourier series: you build complex functions using simple, smooth building blocks. And those blocks are just sine and cosine waves with integer frequencies.
Here’s something subtle but very important: look at how all these harmonic components start and end at the same value — specifically, at zero. Not only that, but their rate of change — or slope — at the beginning and end is also smoothly matched. That’s what allows them to blend so seamlessly when we stack them.

Why does this matter?
Because when you’re representing a periodic function, you want the end of one period to flow naturally into the start of the next. If there’s a mismatch — either in value or in slope — you get a jump, or a kink, which breaks the smoothness of the function. The harmonics are special because they ensure everything lines up perfectly — not just in position, but in motion.

That’s why we call these functions harmonic. They don’t just oscillate — they cooperate. And together, they can mimic anything from a square wave to the shape of a human voice, as long as you choose the right amplitudes and phases.
This is the genius of Fourier’s insight: no matter how jagged or irregular a periodic signal may appear, you can always think of it as being composed of pure tones — harmonics — each contributing its rhythm to the total pattern.

29,"Alright, let’s take a closer look at how the Fourier series works over one complete cycle — that is, over the interval from zero to one.
As we’ve discussed, any well-behaved function on this interval — meaning it’s square-integrable — can be broken down into three types of components.
First, we have what’s called the DC component — written as “a naught divided by two.”
This term represents the average value of the function across the interval. It’s constant — it doesn’t vary or oscillate. You can think of it as the baseline level. For example, in an image, this might represent the overall brightness. In audio, it could be the steady background hum.

Then we have the even parts — these are built using cosine waves.Each term looks like “a n times cosine of two pi n t,” where n is a positive integer: one, two, three, and so on.Cosine is symmetric — if you flip it left to right, it looks exactly the same. That’s why we call these even components — they preserve that mirror-like symmetry.
Next come the odd parts — and these use sine waves.Each term is of the form “b n times sine of two pi n t.”Unlike cosine, sine flips sign when you reflect it, so it captures the antisymmetric — or odd — behavior of the function.
So to sum up:We build the full function using a constant term, plus a sum of cosine waves for the even part, and a sum of sine waves for the odd part. All of these components are weighted by their respective coefficients — a naught, a n, and b n.

And here’s the elegant part:Because we’re working with periodic functions, once you’ve reconstructed the signal over that one interval — from zero to one — the rest of the function just repeats automatically. It’s like tiling the pattern across the entire line.

You can see that idea illustrated in the image at the bottom of the slide.The red waveform shows the reconstructed signal, and the lighter blue curves are the sine and cosine waves that contribute to it. When combined properly, they match the shape of the original function — and then extend it periodically to the left and right.
This kind of decomposition isn’t just theoretical — it has real meaning.
That constant term may represent a background level.
The even parts can capture symmetric patterns in your data.
And the odd parts can highlight asymmetries, like sharp edges or sudden transitions.

So the Fourier series gives us a powerful, structured way to describe a function using just smooth, well-behaved waves — each one tied to a specific frequency and type of symmetry.
Alright, now let’s move on and see how we can compute these coefficients — the values of a naught, a n, and b n — using projection. That’s coming next.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

30,"Before that, here’s a really elegant and surprisingly powerful idea in mathematical analysis — something that’s often overlooked, but incredibly useful in practice.
No matter what function you're dealing with — call it f of x — you can always split it into two parts:an even part, and an odd part.

And here’s how that works.
We define the even part, denoted f e of x, as“f of x plus f of negative x, all divided by two.”
Mathematically, that’s:f e of x equals one-half times the sum of f of x and f of minus x.
If you plug in negative x into this expression, you’ll get:f e of minus x equals one-half times f of minus x plus f of x —which is exactly the same as f e of x.So this part is symmetric — it satisfies the condition of an even function.

Then, we define the odd part, written as f o of x,by subtracting instead of adding. So you get:f o of x equals one-half times f of x minus f of negative x.
Now, if you evaluate this at negative x, you’ll find that:f o of negative x equals negative f o of x.That’s the signature of an odd function — it’s antisymmetric about the origin.

So here’s the beauty:Every function, no matter how it looks, can be written as the sum of its even and odd parts.
In other words,f of x equals f e of x plus f o of x.
This is a universal decomposition — and it's not just a neat identity.
It plays a critical role in understanding symmetry in signals, especially in Fourier analysis, where even and odd functions relate directly to cosine and sine components, respectively.
So remember this trick.Whenever you’re working with a function — especially in signal processing or image analysis — it’s often helpful to ask:What’s its even part? What’s its odd part?And how can we take advantage of that symmetry?
We’ll put this idea to use shortly when we calculate the Fourier coefficients.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

31,"Now that we understand the structure of the Fourier series — with its constant term, cosine terms, and sine terms — the next question is:
How do we actually calculate the coefficients?
These coefficients — which we call a n and b n — are essential.They tell us exactly how much of each sine or cosine function we need in order to construct the original function.Think of them like weights — how much of each frequency should be included in our series.
So, how do we find them?

The answer is beautifully simple — we use inner products.
Remember our earlier discussion: in vector spaces, you can isolate the contribution of a basis vector by projecting onto it.The same logic applies here in the world of functions.Because sine and cosine functions are orthogonal, we can project the function onto each basis element to extract the corresponding coefficient.

Let’s look at this process in the context of the unit interval — from zero to one.
First, to get the a naught coefficient — that’s the DC or constant component —we take the inner product of f of t with the constant function 1.

This gives us:
a naught over 2 equals the integral from 0 to 1 of f of t d t.
So, it’s just the average value of the function over that interval.
Next, for the cosine coefficients, a n,we multiply f of t by the cosine of 2 pi n t, and integrate over the interval from 0 to 1.Then, we multiply the result by 2.

So we have:
a n equals 2 times the integral from 0 to 1 of f of t times cosine of 2 pi n t, d t.
In the same way, to compute the sine coefficients, b n,we do the same thing — but using sine instead of cosine.

So the formula is:
b n equals 2 times the integral from 0 to 1 of f of t times sine of 2 pi n t, d t.
And that’s it.
Each coefficient is computed by projecting the function onto its corresponding basis function — either constant, cosine, or sine.
This is the beauty of orthogonality:Each projection is independent of the others. So we can break the function into clean, non-overlapping components.
It’s like using X, Y, and Z axes in 3D space to describe a vector — but here we’re in an infinite-dimensional space, and our axes are made of smooth waveforms.
Now that we know how to compute these coefficients, we’re ready to apply Fourier series to real examples — and see how they reconstruct signals, even sharp or irregular ones, using only smooth sine and cosine waves.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

32,"Let’s now walk through a concrete example to see how Fourier coefficients are actually computed in practice.

Suppose you’re interested in finding a particular coefficient from the Fourier series — let’s say the coefficient b 3.This is the number that scales the sine term with frequency 3 — in other words, sine of 2 pi times 3 t.

So the question is:How much of this specific sine wave is present in the function f of t?
To answer this, we use a technique we've now seen several times — the inner product.

Here’s what we do:We take the inner product of f of t with sine of 2 pi times 3 t.
Now keep in mind — this sine function is one of our basis elements.It’s a fixed, known waveform. The function f of t is the one we’re analyzing.And because the basis functions are orthonormal, a wonderful thing happens:

When we take this inner product, it acts like a filter.
It scans across the entire Fourier series of f of t, and picks out just the piece that exactly matches sine of 2 pi times 3 t.
All the other terms — the constant term, the cosine terms, and the sine terms with different frequencies likesine of 2 pi t, or sine of 2 pi times 2 t, or sine of 2 pi times 4 t —all of those vanish. Their inner products are zero, because they’re orthogonal to sine of 2 pi times 3 t.
The only term that survives is the one we care about — the one that involves b 3.
So this inner product tells us, precisely and cleanly, what b 3 must be.
And this isn’t just a lucky trick.
It’s a fundamental feature of the Fourier basis —Orthogonality ensures that each coefficient can be extracted independently, with no interference from the others.
In short:To find any Fourier coefficient — whether it’s a n or b n —You simply project the function onto the corresponding sine or cosine basis function.That’s it.
And this is what makes the Fourier series so powerful.It gives us a systematic, elegant way to peel apart the frequency content of a signal — one layer at a time.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

33,"Let’s now practically apply this idea — focusing specifically on how we calculate individual Fourier coefficients.

Suppose we want to compute the coefficient b3 from the Fourier series of some known function — say f of t.
What exactly do we do?
Well, we take the sine function, sine of 2 pi times 3 t, which is one of our orthonormal basis functions, and we compute its inner product with f of t.That means we integrate the product of f of t and sine of 2 pi times 3 t over the interval from 0 to 1.
That’s it.
The result of this integral is exactly the value of b 3.No guessing. No curve fitting. Just a clean calculation using integration.
And this same approach works for any other sine coefficient.To compute b n, you use the sine of 2 pi n t as your basis function, multiply it by f of t, and integrate from 0 to 1.
The same logic applies to the cosine coefficients — the a n terms.To find those, you simply take f of t and compute its inner product with cosine of 2 pi n t.Each integral gives you one specific Fourier coefficient.

Now why does this work so beautifully?
It’s all thanks to the orthonormality of the sine and cosine functions.
When we take an inner product between f of t and any basis function — say, sine of 2 pi times 3 t —only the matching sine term in the Fourier expansion contributes to the result.
All the other basis functions — like the cosines, or sine terms with different frequencies — are orthogonal to this one,so their inner products are zero and they vanish from the computation.
This is exactly like projecting a vector in three-dimensional space.
If you want the x-component of a vector, you project it onto the x-axis.For the y-component, you project onto the y-axis.Same idea here — but now, instead of axes, we have sine and cosine waves.And instead of finite dimensions, we’re working in an infinite-dimensional function space.
So again, orthonormality makes everything work cleanly.It gives us a precise, mathematical way to extract each component of a function in the Fourier basis.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

34,"Now we arrive at a full summary of the real form of the Fourier series.
What we’ve seen so far is that many well-behaved functions — especially those that are continuous and square-integrable — can be expressed as a weighted sum of sine and cosine waves.And this formula at the top captures that structure precisely.

We start with the function f of t.Then we write it as the sum of three components:
First, the DC component, which is a naught over 2. That’s the constant or average value of the function — the non-oscillating part.
Next comes the cosine sum, where each term involves a coefficient a n times cosine of 2 pi n t.
And finally, we have the sine sum, where each term includes b n times sine of 2 pi n t.
These coefficients — a naught, a n, and b n — are what determine how much of each sine or cosine wave contributes to the reconstruction of f of t.
So how do we find them?

Well, we already know the answer from earlier in the lecture: we compute inner products.That is, we take the integral of the product of our function f of t with each basis function, over the interval from 0 to 1.
For the constant term, a naught over 2, we simply integrate f of t from 0 to 1.
To get a n, we multiply f of t by the cosine of 2 pi n t and integrate.
For b n, we do the same with the sine of 2 pi n t.

Once you have these values, you plug them back into the series.And when you sum it all up — the constants, the cosines, and the sines — you recreate your original function, or at least approximate it very closely.
It’s almost magical.You could be working with a smooth parabola, or a sharp triangular wave, or even a jagged, piecewise function — and yet, you can reconstruct it entirely using just sine and cosine waves. That’s the power of the Fourier series.

Now, remember earlier in the course we looked at functions in terms of discrete particles or impulses — like pixel-based representations. That gave us a kind of particle view of functions.
But this approach gives us a wave-based view — continuous, smooth, and grounded in frequency content.
Both are valid. And each is powerful in its own context.

But here’s a question worth asking:Why would we ever want to use the complex form of the Fourier series?
Well, look at this real version. It’s elegant, yes — but it involves three separate types of terms: one for the DC component, one for cosine, and one for sine.
By switching to the complex form, we can merge all of this into a single sum using Euler’s formula, where complex exponentials capture both sine and cosine behavior simultaneously.
This makes the whole formulation more compact and symmetrical.
The math becomes cleaner. The algebra gets easier. And in engineering applications, it often leads to more efficient computations.
So while the real form gives us intuitive clarity, the complex form offers analytical elegance.
That’s exactly where we’re headed next.
Let’s now explore how complex numbers help us take the Fourier series to the next level.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:

35,"Now let’s take a step into the world of complex numbers, because they offer a beautifully compact and powerful way to handle Fourier analysis.

We begin with something that might feel a little strange at first — the definition of the imaginary unit, denoted by the letter i.
By definition, i squared equals negative one. That is:
i squared equals minus one.

Now, this seems counterintuitive, right? Because in the world of real numbers, squaring anything always gives you something non-negative. But here, we're stepping beyond the real line, into a new dimension — one that allows us to define numbers that include this imaginary unit.
And that opens the door to complex numbers.
A complex number, typically written as z, is defined as:
z = x plus i times y,
where x is the real part, and y is the imaginary part.Geometrically, you can think of this as a point on the complex plane — with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis.
Now, for every complex number, we can define something called its conjugate.If z is x plus i times y, then the conjugate of z, written with a bar over it, is:
x minus I times y.

This is like flipping the point across the real axis — mirroring it vertically.
Now, let’s look at how we add and multiply complex numbers.The rules are very similar to regular algebra — you just have to remember that i squared is negative one. That’s the only twist.
So, for instance, if we add two complex numbers, we just add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately.If we multiply them, we expand the product just like you would with binomials — but we substitute i squared with minus one when it appears.
From here, we can also extract the real and imaginary parts of a complex number using its conjugate:
The real part is the average of the number and its conjugate — that’s z plus z bar divided by two.
The imaginary part is the difference between the number and its conjugate, divided by 2 i.

Now, you might be wondering — how does all this tie back to Fourier analysis?
Well, just as we defined inner products for real-valued functions, we can do the same for complex-valued functions.And when we do, we often need to deal with conjugates inside integrals.

Here’s the rule:If you take the complex conjugate of an integral — say, the integral of f of t times g of t — that’s equal to the integral of f conjugate times g conjugate.
This is especially important when we compute energy, projection, or coefficients in complex signal spaces.

Also, in engineering and physics, we frequently use the star notation — an asterisk — to indicate conjugation. So if you see a star on the outside of an integral, that means we’re conjugating the whole result.Likewise, when it’s applied to the functions inside, it means we're conjugating those functions individually.
So why go through all of this?
Because working with complex numbers — especially when combined with Euler’s formula, which we’ll see shortly — allows us to unify sine and cosine into a single, elegant expression. That’s a huge simplification.

And that’s the real power of this approach:Cleaner math, fewer terms, and deeper symmetry.
So with that, we’re now ready to look at the complex form of the Fourier series, which brings everything we've learned into one compact representation.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

36,"When we work with complex numbers, there are two very common ways to describe them:the Cartesian form and the polar form.Both are fully equivalent, and they each offer a different way of thinking about the same quantity.

Let’s begin with the Cartesian form. This is what we’ve seen already:A complex number is written as x plus i times y, where x is the real part, and y is the imaginary part.So we’re essentially giving the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a point in the complex plane — just like specifying a location on a map.

Now, in engineering, we often replace the symbol i with j to represent the imaginary unit. This is purely to avoid confusion — because in electrical engineering, i is usually reserved for current.But mathematically, i and j mean the same thing: they both satisfy the fundamental property that i squared equals negative one.
The other way to describe a complex number is through polar coordinates.Instead of saying how far right and up the point is, we describe the number by its magnitude and angle.
So what does that mean?

We draw a line from the origin to the point — that’s the complex number — and call its length r. That’s the magnitude, or modulus, and it’s calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:r equals the square root of x squared plus y squared.This is also written as the absolute value of z.

Next, we describe the angle that line makes with the positive real axis.That angle is called theta, and we compute it as the inverse tangent of y over x.So now, we have two pieces: r and theta — the magnitude and direction.
With that, we can now express the same complex number in polar form.
In place of x plus i y, we write:
r times cosine theta plus i times r sine theta.Or, factoring out the r:r times the quantity cosine theta plus i sine theta.

This is the foundation for something beautiful: Euler’s formula, which we’ll talk about in the next slide.Euler discovered that cosine theta plus i sine theta is equal to e to the i theta — giving us a powerful exponential representation of complex numbers.
Before we leave this slide, here’s one more important result:If you multiply a complex number by its conjugate — in other words, z times z bar — you get a purely real number.

Let’s walk through it:z is x plus i y, and its conjugate is x minus i y.When you multiply them together, you get x squared plus y squared, which is just the magnitude squared.
This shows that the conjugate cancels out the imaginary part, leaving only a real value — something very useful in analysis and signal processing.
So just like vectors, complex numbers let us switch back and forth between rectangular and polar systems.
Each form brings its own advantages, and we’ll soon see how this flexibility pays off — especially when we start rewriting Fourier series using complex exponentials.
Let’s move to Euler’s formula and take this further.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

37,"So far, we’ve been casually treating the inner product as a simple dot product — point-by-point multiplication followed by a sum. That works just fine when we’re dealing with real-valued vectors.
But when we step into complex vector spaces, things get a bit more subtle. In particular, we have to be careful with how we define the inner product. In the complex world, it’s not enough to just multiply and add — we also need to take the complex conjugate of one of the vectors before doing so.
Let’s break this down with a simple example.

Suppose we have two complex vectors. Let’s call them X and Y.
Vector X has two components:the first is a one plus b one times i,and the second is a two plus b two times i.
Similarly, vector Y has components:c one plus d one times i,and c two plus d two times i.
Now, how do we compute the length of vector X?
In complex space, we use the sum of the squared magnitudes of each component. So the magnitude of X is the square root ofa one squared plus b one squared plus a two squared plus b two squared.
We do the same for vector Y — square the real and imaginary parts of each component, add them up, and then take the square root.

Now, here’s the key idea.
If these two complex vectors — X and Y — are orthogonal, and we add them together to form a new vector Z, we expect the squared length of Z to equal the squared length of X plus the squared length of Y. That’s just the Pythagorean theorem in vector space.
But for that identity to hold, one critical condition must be met:the cross-term — the inner product between X and Y — must vanish. In other words, the inner product between X and Y has to be zero.
And this is where the complex conjugate becomes important.

In real vector spaces, we just take the dot product. But in complex spaces, we define the inner product as:X dot Y conjugate.
That means, we keep vector X as it is, and we take the complex conjugate of each component of Y before multiplying.
This adjustment ensures that everything works out mathematically:we preserve orthogonality, we maintain proper lengths, and we uphold the geometry of the space.
So, whenever we’re working with complex vectors — in signal processing, in quantum mechanics, or in Fourier analysis — this conjugation step is absolutely essential.

Now, don’t worry about memorizing the formulas. That’s why I added this green bubble here — it’s just a reminder that this is more about understanding the concept than remembering every detail.
Once you internalize this idea — that conjugation is needed to define meaningful inner products in complex space — everything that follows, including the complex form of the Fourier series, will feel much more natural.
Let’s now move forward and apply this idea in the Fourier domain.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

38,"Now that we’ve introduced the concept of inner products for complex vectors, let’s take a closer look at how the definition actually works — and more importantly, why it includes a conjugate.

In a real-valued vector space, things are simple. You multiply corresponding components and sum the results. But in a complex space, if we follow that same rule — just multiplying and summing — we may end up with a complex number. And that’s a problem, because when we’re measuring things like length, or comparing angles between vectors, we need real values.

So here’s what we do instead.
We define the inner product of two complex-valued functions, let’s say f of t and g of t, by integrating the product of f of t and the complex conjugate of g of t.
Symbolically, we write:⟨f of t, g of t⟩ equals the integral from minus infinity to infinity of f of t times g star of t, d t.

That’s our general definition. But often, we work over a specific interval — for example, from zero to one. In that case, we write:⟨f of t, g of t⟩ equals the integral from 0 to 1 of f of t times g star of t, d t.

Now, why is this conjugation so important?
Well, imagine taking the inner product of a function with itself. We’d expect that result to be real and non-negative — something that represents the square of the function’s length or its energy. But without the conjugate, we might get a complex number, which doesn’t make physical sense in that context.
The conjugate takes care of that. It ensures the phase — or directional twist — of the complex function is canceled out. What’s left is the amplitude — the magnitude — and that’s what we care about when computing lengths or measuring how much two functions align.

Another way to see this is: the conjugate helps us ignore the phase and focus purely on the size or strength of the signal.
So this isn’t just a technical tweak — it’s what makes the geometry of complex spaces work. Thanks to the conjugate, we preserve all the essential properties:orthogonality, projection, the norm — and more.
So when we say two complex-valued functions are orthogonal, we mean that their inner product — including the conjugate — is zero. That’s the complex equivalent of vectors being at right angles.
This is why conjugates appear everywhere in Fourier analysis and other areas involving complex functions. They ensure consistency and meaning across the entire framework.

So, to summarize:In complex function spaces, an inner product is defined using integration with conjugation.That’s the key idea — and it makes everything else fall neatly into place.

39,"All right, now that we've got a solid understanding of complex numbers, let’s talk about one of the most beautiful and powerful results in mathematics—Euler’s Formula.

Let’s start with the exponential function. You might remember that the exponential of a number can be written as an infinite series. For any complex number z, we can write:
“e to the z equals one, plus z over one factorial, plus z squared over two factorial, plus z cubed over three factorial, and so on.”
In math terms, that’s:
  e to the z equals the sum from n equals zero to infinity of z to the n over n factorial.
This series works not only for real numbers, but also for complex numbers. And that’s important.
How do we know this infinite sum still makes sense when z is complex? Well, there’s something called the ratio test, which shows that this series converges no matter what complex number we use. In other words, it always gives a valid result. That’s why we can define e to the z for any complex number z. That’s a big deal.

Now, here’s where things get really exciting.
What if we plug in a purely imaginary number, like i times theta, into this exponential?
It turns out that:
  e to the i theta equals cosine theta plus i times sine theta.
That’s Euler’s formula.

This equation is incredibly elegant. It shows how exponential functions and trigonometric functions—two ideas that seem totally different—are actually deeply connected.
And here’s something even more useful. If you rearrange Euler’s formula a bit, you can write cosine and sine in terms of complex exponentials.

Specifically:
  Cosine theta equals e to the i theta plus e to the minus i theta, divided by two.
  Sine theta equals e to the i theta minus e to the minus i theta, divided by two i.
These two identities are incredibly helpful, especially in signal processing and Fourier analysis. They let us replace sines and cosines with exponentials, which makes the math much cleaner and often easier to compute.

So to sum up:
Euler’s formula is a bridge between the world of waves—like sine and cosine—and the world of exponentials. And as we’ll see next, that bridge is exactly what we need to rewrite the Fourier series in a compact, exponential form.
Let’s move forward and take a look at that next.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

40,"Now that we’ve built up our understanding of Euler’s formula, we’re ready to transition from the real form of the Fourier series to the complex form.

Let me start by reminding you of the real version. For a periodic function, f of t, we can write it as:
  ""a zero divided by two, plus the sum over n of a n times cosine of two pi n t, plus b n times sine of two pi n t.""
That’s the standard real Fourier series form. We’ve seen that it works well, but it requires us to carry around both sine and cosine terms—and two separate sets of coefficients.

Now here’s the trick: using Euler’s formula, we can rewrite sine and cosine using complex exponentials.
For example, cosine of two pi n t becomes:
  ""e to the power i times two pi n t, plus e to the power negative i times two pi n t, all divided by two.""
And sine of two pi n t becomes:
  ""e to the i two pi n t, minus e to the negative i two pi n t, all divided by two i.""

So what’s the point of doing this?
Well, once we’ve written everything in terms of exponentials, we can merge the sine and cosine parts into one unified expression. Everything now becomes a sum of complex exponentials—no separate sine and cosine terms needed.

Even more interesting, these exponential functions—like e to the i two pi n t—where n is any integer, actually form an orthonormal basis.
That means: each function has unit length, and all the functions are mutually orthogonal. If you take the inner product of e to the i two pi m t and e to the i two pi n t, the result is:
  ""one, if m equals n; and zero, if m is not equal to n.""
This elegant structure is one of the biggest reasons we prefer the complex form in many applications. It makes the math cleaner, the derivations simpler, and the overall representation more compact.

So in summary: by converting sine and cosine into exponentials using Euler’s identity, we arrive at a cleaner and more powerful way to express Fourier series. And this sets the stage for everything that follows in frequency analysis and Fourier transforms.

41,"Let’s take a moment now to fully understand what we mean by an orthonormal basis, especially when we’re working with complex exponentials.

We define a family of functions—denoted e n of t—where each function is written as:  ""e to the power two pi i n t.""Here, n is any integer, and t is in the interval from zero to one.
Now, to confirm that these functions actually form an orthonormal basis, we’ll compute the inner product between two of them. Let’s say we have e n t and e m t, and n is not equal to m.
Since we’re in a complex function space, remember that we have to conjugate the second function when we compute the inner product.So, the inner product between e n and e m is:  ""The integral from zero to one of e to the two pi i n t, times the complex conjugate of e to the two pi i m t.""
Now, taking the conjugate of an exponential just flips the sign in the exponent. So this product becomes:  ""e to the power two pi i times the quantity n minus m, all times t.""We’re now integrating this from zero to one.What happens?
Well, if n is not equal to m, this exponential is rotating in the complex plane over the entire interval, and the total contribution over one period averages out to zero.So, in that case, the inner product is zero. This confirms that the functions are orthogonal when n and m are different.

Now, what if n equals m?Then the exponent becomes zero, so we’re simply integrating the constant function one, from zero to one. That gives us a value of one.So this confirms that the functions are normalized when n equals m.Putting both of these observations together, we have the classic orthonormality condition:  ""The inner product of e n and e m is equal to one if n equals m, and zero otherwise.""That’s exactly what we expect from an orthonormal basis.

These complex exponential functions form the mathematical backbone of the Fourier series. Each function is like a “building block” that carries a particular frequency, and together they allow us to represent almost any function on the interval from zero to one.This structure is elegant, efficient, and deeply powerful.And in the next step, we’ll use these building blocks to express the complex form of the Fourier series.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

42,"Now that we’ve built the full foundation, we’re finally ready to write down the complex form of the Fourier series.Instead of expressing our function f of t using separate sine and cosine terms, we now use complex exponentials as the basis functions. And the result is both beautiful and powerful.We write:""f of t equals the sum, from n equals negative infinity to positive infinity, of c n times e to the power i two pi n t.""So here, each term in the sum is a complex sinusoid at frequency n. And the corresponding coefficient, c n, tells us how much of that frequency is present in the signal.
Now, how do we find each coefficient?Because our basis functions are orthonormal, we can isolate any one coefficient simply by taking the inner product of f with the exponential function e to the i two pi n t. That gives us:""c n equals the inner product of f of t and e to the i two pi n t,""""which equals the integral from zero to one of f of t times e to the negative i two pi n t, with respect to t.""Notice here that minus sign in the exponent. That comes from taking the complex conjugate inside the inner product.This formula is incredibly useful—it gives us a direct way to compute each coefficient without interference from the others.
Now, if you recall the real Fourier series with cosine and sine terms, and if you rewrite cosine and sine using Euler’s formulas, and substitute them back into the real series, you’ll get the same expression—but now in terms of complex exponentials.And the coefficients come out as:For non-zero n,""c n equals a n over two, minus i times b n over two.""For n equals zero,""c zero equals a zero over two.""
So the complex coefficients still capture the exact same information as a n, b n, and a naught—but now in a more compact and unified form.And finally, if your function f of t is real-valued, then the Fourier coefficients have a special property called conjugate symmetry. That is:""The complex conjugate of c n equals c negative n.""This symmetry ensures that when you sum the exponentials—both positive and negative frequencies—the imaginary parts cancel out, and you’re left with a real-valued function.
So to summarize, this complex form of the Fourier series gives us a cleaner expression, easier computation, and a deeper insight into the structure of signals. It’s no surprise this form is central in many areas, from signal processing to quantum mechanics.Next, we’ll build on this to explore how these complex exponentials serve as building blocks for signal decomposition and frequency-domain analysis.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

43,"Let’s take a step back now and try to visualize everything we've been talking about.
When we say we’re representing a function using a Fourier series, what does that mean? 

Well, it means we’re placing that function inside a kind of infinite-dimensional space. Each dimension in this space corresponds to a different basis function—just like in three-dimensional space, where we have the x, y, and z axes.
On the left side of this slide, you see the real basis. These are made up of the constant function 1, the cosine functions like cosine of 2 pi m t, and the sine functions like sine of 2 pi n t. These real functions are all orthonormal, and together, they span the space of all square-integrable periodic functions.

Now notice the red arrow labeled f of t. That red arrow represents a function. And just like any vector in 3D space, we can express this function as a sum of its components in each direction. But in our case, the directions are sine, cosine, and the constant function.
To figure out how much of each component is present, we project the function onto each basis function. That’s exactly what we’re doing when we compute the Fourier coefficients. We're just asking: how much of cosine is in this signal? How much of sine? And so on.

Now look at the right-hand diagram. It shows the same idea, but using a complex basis instead. Here, the directions are complex exponentials like e to the i 2 pi n t. These complex exponentials are also orthonormal and form a complete basis in the complex function space.
The red arrow here, labeled g of t, could represent the same function as f of t. But now, it’s decomposed using complex components instead of sines and cosines.
So whether we use real functions or complex exponentials, the concept is the same: we're decomposing a function into its “directional” components in function space—just like how you decompose a 3D vector into its x, y, and z parts.

This visualization helps us see Fourier series not just as a bunch of formulas—but as a geometric idea. A function is a vector, and we’re expressing it as a sum of basis vectors.
This is the heart of Fourier analysis.
Next, let’s take a look at some concrete examples to see how this actually plays out in practice.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

44,"Let’s wrap up this lecture by exploring a concrete and classic example: the square wave.
What you see here is a periodic function, one that flips back and forth between two constant values—a positive one and a negative one.

Let’s walk through the structure.
From time t equals zero up to one-half, the function holds steady at plus one. Then, from one-half to one, it suddenly drops to minus one. After that, the pattern repeats. And again. And again. This continues infinitely in both directions along the time axis.
So overall, this is a piecewise function. Within each period, it's constant in two segments, with an abrupt jump at the halfway point. And because it repeats every unit of time, we say it has a period of one.

Now, at first glance, you might think, “This function is too rough for sine and cosine to handle.” It has sharp edges, and it jumps suddenly. But that’s where the power of Fourier analysis shines.
Even though the square wave is not smooth, we can still represent it as a sum of smooth, continuous sinusoids. It’s exactly this kind of jumpy, discontinuous behavior that makes the square wave such a great test case for the Fourier series.

You’ll soon see that we can approximate the square wave by adding up enough sine components. And the more terms we include, the closer the sum will come to capturing that sharp transition from plus one to minus one.
This example will also reveal an interesting phenomenon known as the Gibbs effect, which we’ll talk about next.
But for now, just keep in mind: even for a simple-looking function like this square wave, Fourier series gives us a powerful and systematic way to build it up—using only smooth building blocks.

So now let’s take the next step and compute the Fourier coefficients for our square wave.

As we saw before, the square wave alternates between plus one and minus one over each period. From zero to one-half, it’s plus one. From one-half to one, it drops to minus one. And this pattern repeats every unit interval.

Now, we begin with the zeroth Fourier coefficient. This represents the average value of the function over one period. But notice: for every positive bump, there’s a negative one of equal size. So the total area above the axis cancels out the area below. That means the average value is zero.
So, the zeroth term disappears.

Next, we compute the other Fourier coefficients, often denoted by f-hat of n. These are obtained by taking the inner product of the function with the complex exponential e to the negative 2 pi i n t.
Since our square wave has two constant segments, we split the integral into two parts: one from 0 to one-half, where the function equals plus one, and one from one-half to 1, where the function equals minus one.
We integrate e to the negative 2 pi i n t over each of these intervals, then subtract them.

After doing the math, we arrive at this compact expression:
F hat n equals to 1 over pi i n times the quantity 1 minus e to the negative pi i n.

Now this is an elegant formula. It tells us exactly how strong each frequency component is. For each integer value of n—not equal to zero—we get a corresponding complex exponential that contributes to building up the square wave.

And so, we write the full Fourier series as an infinite sum of these terms. That is, summing over all non-zero values of n:
The sum of 1 over pi i n times 1 minus e to the negative pi i n times e to the 2 pi i n t
Each of these exponential functions corresponds to a specific frequency, and each coefficient tells us how much of that frequency is present in the signal.
On the next slide, we’ll further simplify this result and begin to see the pattern more clearly—especially for odd harmonics.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
45,"Now let’s simplify the Fourier series we derived for the square wave.
Earlier, we saw that the Fourier coefficients involved a term like “1 minus e to the negative pi i n.” Let’s think carefully about that. What happens when n is even?

Well, if you plug in an even number, this expression becomes zero. That means: all even-numbered terms in the series disappear completely. On the other hand, when n is odd, this term evaluates to two.
So what does this tell us? It tells us that the square wave is made up only of odd harmonics. That is, only the sine waves whose frequencies are odd multiples of the base frequency will appear in the final expression.
With this insight, we rewrite the series, summing over only the odd values of n. And since the numerator is just 2 now, the coefficient simplifies to 2 over pi i n, multiplied by e to the 2 pi i n t.

Now we go one step further. We combine the terms for plus n and minus n. When we do that and apply Euler’s identity again, something beautiful happens. The sum of e to the i theta and e to the negative i theta becomes a sine function. Specifically:
e to the 2 pi i n t minus e to the minus 2 pi i n t equals 2 i times sine of 2 pi n t
So now, our series, which originally looked complex and full of exponentials, becomes a clean sine series.
We make one last substitution. Since we’re only keeping odd values of n, we can write n as 2 k plus 1, where k runs from zero to infinity.

This gives us the final, elegant result:
f of t equals 4 over pi, times the sum from k equals 0 to infinity, of 1 over 2 k plus 1, times sine of 2 pi times 2 k plus 1 t
This is the Fourier series for the square wave.

Notice how only sine terms appear. That makes perfect sense, because the square wave is an odd function—it’s symmetric around the origin. And in Fourier analysis, odd functions naturally expand into sine terms, just like even functions expand into cosines.
This result is not only beautiful but also extremely useful. It tells us exactly how to build a square wave by layering together the right sine waves, each scaled just right.
Let’s go on and see what this looks like when we actually approximate the square wave with a few of these terms.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

46,"Let’s take a moment now to understand what happens when we approximate a function using only a finite number of Fourier terms.
In theory, the Fourier series uses infinitely many sine or complex exponential terms to exactly reconstruct the original function. But in practice, we can only sum up a limited number of them. So what does that mean?

Well, in regions where the function is smooth and continuous, like in the middle of a flat section of the square wave, the approximation is excellent. The series follows the shape of the function very closely, and the error becomes negligible as we include more terms.
But notice what happens at the discontinuities—those sudden jumps where the function goes from 1 to 1. That’s where the series begins to struggle.

If you look at the plot here, you’ll see a ripple near each jump. These ripples don’t go away even if we add more and more terms. This phenomenon is known as the Gibbs phenomenon, and we’ll explore it in detail shortly.
For now, focus on what the formula in the blue box is telling us. It describes the value that the Fourier series converges to at each point x.
If the function f of x is continuous at that point, then the Fourier series converges to f of x. That’s simple enough.
But if the function is discontinuous, then the series converges to the average of the left-hand and right-hand limits. Mathematically, that means:
S of x equals one-half times f of x from the left, plus f of x from the right

So the series doesn’t “miss” the function entirely at the jump—it just lands at the midpoint. This is a subtle but important point: the Fourier series always converges to something, and that something is precisely defined.
In summary, finite Fourier series work very well across most of the domain, but they introduce oscillations and errors around jumps. That’s an inherent limitation of this type of approximation—and next, we’ll give this behavior a name and look more closely at its mathematical structure.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
47,"Now here’s something truly fascinating—and unavoidable—when working with Fourier series. It’s known as the Gibbs effect.

Let’s revisit what we saw on the previous slide. When we try to approximate a function with a sudden jump, like our square wave, the Fourier series doesn’t quite nail the jump. Instead, it creates an oscillatory overshoot near the point of discontinuity. You can see these ripples in the red-highlighted regions on this plot.

What’s important to understand here is that this overshoot doesn’t disappear—even if we use hundreds or thousands of terms. Yes, the oscillations become more tightly packed, clustering closer to the jump. But the height of the overshoot—the peak error—does not go away.
It approaches a fixed value—about 9 percent of the jump in the function. That’s the defining feature of the Gibbs effect.

So why does this happen? Well, the Fourier series is built from smooth, continuous waves—like sines and cosines or complex exponentials. But when we try to represent a sharp edge—a discontinuity—using only smooth components, we hit a fundamental limit. There’s no perfect way to form a step out of waves.
This mismatch creates those persistent ripples. It’s not a bug in the method—it’s a deep mathematical truth.

So even though the Fourier approximation converges pointwise almost everywhere, and even in the sense of least squares, it never perfectly resolves a jump. This is especially important in applications like signal processing or image reconstruction, where sharp edges and sudden transitions often appear.
The takeaway is: when you see these ringing effects around edges in a Fourier approximation, you're witnessing the Gibbs effect in action.
Let’s now bring all this together with a final reflection on what we’ve learned from the square wave example.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

48,"So far, we’ve assumed that the function we’re analyzing is periodic with a period of one. But in real applications, that’s not always the case. The period might be two, five, or even some irrational number like pi. So how do we handle that?

It turns out the Fourier series still works perfectly—we just need to adjust our formula to account for the actual period, which we’ll call capital T.
The idea is simple: we scale the time variable by dividing it by T. That way, we bring the problem back into a familiar form—similar to what we did when the period was one.

So the Fourier series becomes:
f of t equals the sum over all n from negative infinity to infinity of c n times e to the power i 2 pi n t over T.

Let me say that again more slowly:
We write the function f of t as the sum of c n times e raised to the power i times two pi times n times t divided by T.
Now what about the coefficients?
We compute c n using an integral over one full period. And we have two equivalent options for that:

First option:
c n equals one over T times the integral from zero to capital T of f of t times e to the power negative i 2 pi n t over T, integrated with respect to t.
Or, second option:
c n equals one over T times the integral from negative T over 2 to positive T over 2 of f of t times e to the power negative i 2 pi n t over T, again integrated with respect to t.

Either form works. The only difference is the range of integration—whether you go from zero to T or from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2.

So what’s the takeaway?
This is just a change of variable. We're scaling time so that the period becomes one, applying all our previous results, and then scaling back.

This gives us a general version of the Fourier series that works for any period—not just the special case where the period is one.
And this flexibility is exactly what makes the Fourier series so powerful. It adapts easily to the structure of whatever signal you're analyzing.
Up next, we’ll take this idea even further and connect it to the Fourier transform, which is what happens when the period becomes infinitely large.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

49,"Up to this point, everything we’ve talked about has been in one dimension. But in real-world applications—especially in imaging—we usually work with two-dimensional data. Think about a photograph, a CT slice, or an MRI frame. These are functions of two variables, not just one.
So, does the Fourier series still apply? Absolutely. In fact, the transition to two dimensions is very smooth and intuitive.

Let’s start with the formula at the top. This is the 2D Fourier transform, or more precisely, the 2D discrete Fourier series. It converts a spatial domain function into a frequency domain representation.

We begin with a function f of m and n. Here, m and n are the spatial coordinates, like pixel row and column indices.
Then we compute the capital F of x and y, which is the frequency-domain representation of the image. We get it using a double summation—from m equals 0 to M minus 1, and from n equals 0 to N minus 1.
Each term in the sum includes f of m and n, multiplied by a complex exponential:e to the power negative j 2 pi times x times m over M plus y times n over N.
This is just the 2D extension of what we did before in 1D—now applied along both spatial directions.

Next, let’s look at the inverse transform—the formula at the bottom.
Here, we reconstruct the original image, f of m and n, from its frequency components, F of x and y. Again, we use a double summation ranging from 0 to M minus 1 and N minus 1.
And we add a normalization factor of 1 divided by M times N.
The exponential now becomes:e to the power positive j 2 pi times x times m over M plus y times n over N.

So once again, we’re projecting onto a set of complex exponential basis functions—just like in the 1D case, but now expanded to two dimensions.
This idea even extends naturally to three dimensions, which is useful for things like volumetric imaging, 3D scans, or dynamic time-sequence data in medical imaging.

So to summarize: the 2D Fourier series gives us a powerful way to analyze images in terms of spatial frequencies. It's conceptually the same as the 1D case—just applied in two directions simultaneously.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

3,"Now, let’s break things down to a very basic and powerful idea.

Suppose we have a function — let’s call it f of t — a one-dimensional function that varies over time. You can think of it as a smooth, continuous curve. That’s the usual way we look at functions.
But here’s a different perspective — instead of seeing f of t as one continuous piece, imagine it as a sum of impulses. Yes — a collection of sharp, narrow spikes, each carrying a little bit of information about the function at a specific time.

This is where the Dirac delta function, or delta for short, comes in. From linear systems theory, we know that any continuous function can be viewed as the convolution of that function with a train of delta functions.

What does this mean, intuitively? It means you can imagine slicing the original function into many tiny segments. Each segment becomes a small impulse — and when you add up all those impulses, you reconstruct the full function.
So, this is one way to represent a function — not as a smooth line, but as a weighted sum of sharp impulses. And this idea is going to be very helpful as we move toward the Fourier transform.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
4,"Now let’s look at the same function from a completely different angle — instead of seeing it as a sum of impulses, imagine it as a sum of waves.

Here, we’re working with a periodic function — meaning it repeats itself over time. Let’s just focus on one complete cycle of that function. The rest are just copies.
The key idea is this: a periodic function like this can be broken down into many sine and cosine waves — we call these sinusoidal components. These waves can vary in three ways: their frequency, which tells us how fast they oscillate; their amplitude, which tells us how tall they are; and their phase, which tells us where each wave starts.

So what’s the trick? We want to find the right combination of amplitudes, frequencies, and phases — so that when we add up all these sine and cosine waves, we recover the original function.
At first, this might sound abstract, but conceptually it’s not that difficult. You’re just looking at the same function in a different way.
Earlier, we saw a kind of particle view — slicing the function into sharp impulses. Now we’re seeing a wave view — smoothing it into oscillating signals.
And this wave-based view is the foundation for Fourier analysis.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
5,"So now that we've talked about breaking a function into a sum of waves, let's formalize that idea using the real form of the Fourier series.

What we’re looking at here is just a mathematical way of saying: any periodic function f of t can be written as a combination of three types of components:
A constant term, called the DC component,
A sum of cosine terms,
And a sum of sine terms.
Each term has a different frequency and amplitude, depending on the value of n. The higher the value of n, the higher the frequency of that term.

So the general formula goes like this:
f of t equals a-zero over 2, plus the sum from n equals 1 to N of a-n times cosine of 2 pi n t, plus b-n times sine of 2 pi n t.
Now, where do these coefficients come from?
Well, we have formulas to compute them. That’s the trick!
To find a zero, you integrate f of t from 0 to 1.
To find a-n, you multiply f of t with cosine of 2 pi n t, and integrate.
And for b-n, you do the same, but with sine of 2 pi n t.

So if I give you any function f of t, you just plug it into these formulas, do the math, and you get a set of numbers — the a’s and b’s. With those coefficients, you can then reconstruct the original function by summing all the sine and cosine waves.
As N gets larger — meaning you include more wave components — the reconstructed function becomes more and more accurate. In fact, when N approaches infinity, this series can represent the function exactly, under reasonable conditions.

Now here’s something deeper: These sine and cosine functions form an orthonormal basis — that’s just a fancy way of saying they’re like the X, Y, and Z axes in 3D space, but in an infinite-dimensional space of functions.
So geometrically, what you're doing is projecting the function f of t onto each basis function — kind of like breaking a 3D vector into its X, Y, and Z components. Except here, we’re breaking a function into sine, cosine, and constant components.

If this all feels a bit abstract, don’t worry. The key takeaway is:We’re representing a function as a sum of waves.And we have formulas that let us find the right weights — or coefficients — for those waves.
That’s what the Fourier series, in its real form, is all about.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
6,"So far, we've talked about the real form of the Fourier series, which uses sine and cosine functions. But there's another way to write the same idea — in what we call the complex form.

Now don’t be alarmed by the word “complex.” This version is mathematically equivalent to the real form — it's just more compact and elegant.
Instead of separating things into sines and cosines, we use complex exponentials — specifically, e to the power of 2 pi i n t. That’s Euler’s formula at work.
In this form, the function f of t is expressed as a sum — from n equals minus N to N — of coefficients c n multiplied by e to the 2 pi i n t.
And just like before, we need to figure out those coefficients. So how do we compute c n?

We use this formula:c n equals the integral from 0 to 1 of e to the power minus 2 pi i n t times f of t, with respect to t.
This is essentially an inner product — projecting your function onto the exponential basis function e to the power minus 2 pi i n t. 

In my book, I like to write the imaginary unit i in front — as in minus i 2 pi n t — but it’s just a matter of notation. The meaning stays the same.
At the bottom here, you see the same formula written slightly differently — as f-hat of n — which is just another way of naming the coefficient.

Now, throughout this slide, we’re assuming that the function is periodic with unit period — meaning it repeats every interval from 0 to 1. If the function instead repeats from, say, 100 to 101, it’s still the same picture — just shifted.
So the complex form doesn't change the logic — it simply gives us a cleaner, more powerful way to write and manipulate Fourier series, especially when we move into Fourier transforms.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:

7,"So far, we’ve been working under a simple assumption — that the function we’re analyzing has a unit period. That means the function repeats every one unit of time, say, from 0 to 1.

But what if the period is something else — like 5, or 100? That’s what we’re covering here.
This slide shows how to handle a function with an arbitrary period, which we’ll call capital T. The good news is: the concept stays exactly the same — we’re still breaking the function into complex exponential components — but we just adjust the formulas a bit.

Here’s how the function f of t is now written:
f of t equals the sum from n equals minus infinity to infinity of c n times e to the power i 2 pi n t over T.
So you can think of this as a generalized version of the complex Fourier series.

And to compute the coefficient c n, we use the formula:
c n equals 1 over capital T, times the integral from minus T over 2 to T over 2 of e to the power minus i 2 pi n t over T, which is multiplied by f of t, with respect to t.

Now let me break that down for you:
The exponential term — that’s your harmonic basis function, adjusted for the new period.
t over T is just a way to normalize time, so that we’re still operating over a standard interval.
The 1 over T in front is a scaling factor that makes everything work out correctly.
And the range of integration — from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2 — gives us a symmetric interval, which is often more convenient for analysis.

So, whether your period is 1, 10, or any other positive number, you simply use T in place of 1 and apply this formula. You’re still summing wave-like components — just stretched or compressed in time depending on the period.
Now here’s something helpful:If you set T equals 1, this formula reduces back to the unit-period version we saw before. So you only need to remember this general form — and adjust T as needed.

In practice, the real form of the Fourier series is nice because it gives you a clear geometric picture — sines, cosines, and their amplitudes.The complex form, like the one we see here, is more compact and elegant, especially when we move into transforms. It just takes a little abstract thinking in complex space.

8,"By now, you might be wondering — why go through all this? Why even bother with the Fourier transform?
Well, let’s take a step back and think with common sense.

We started with a function — f of t — and we’ve looked at several ways to represent it. First, we saw it as a sum of impulses. Then, as a sum of waves — sines and cosines. Each of these views gives us a different lens to understand the same signal.
And that’s the point. Multiple perspectives give us more flexibility and smarter strategies for solving problems.

In real life, when you're facing a tough task, what do you usually do? You don’t try to tackle it head-on in the hardest way possible. You try to simplify it. You look for shortcuts. You use tools that make the problem easier.
That’s exactly what we’re doing with Fourier analysis.
Sometimes a problem looks really messy in the time domain — but if we switch to the Fourier domain, that same problem might become simple and elegant.

Here’s an analogy: imagine trying to do multiplication using Roman numerals. It’s a nightmare! But switch to Arabic numerals — or even binary — and suddenly, multiplication becomes easy. Especially for computers.
So choosing the right representation can make all the difference.
That’s what the Fourier transform is all about. It gives us a new way to look at a function — in terms of its frequency content — and often, that view makes analysis or computation much simpler.

There’s also a deeper strategy here:Sometimes a function is complicated as a whole, but if we break it down into smaller, simpler parts, we can understand it better.
This is the classic divide and conquer approach.
We’ve already seen this with impulse decomposition. If you know how a system responds to a single impulse, then you can figure out how it will respond to a complicated signal — just by adding up the responses to each impulse.
The same logic applies to sine waves — if you understand how a system reacts to one sine wave, and you can express a signal as a sum of sine waves, then you’ve got the whole picture.

So, in short, Fourier analysis follows two powerful principles:
Use simple tools to solve complex problems.
Divide big problems into small, manageable pieces.
And that’s what we’re building toward with the Fourier transform.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

Here’s how we’ll structure today’s lecture:
First, in Section 1, we’ll talk about how the Fourier transform is derived from the Fourier series. This transition is logical and elegant, and it gives us a solid foundation for everything that follows.

Then, in Section 2, we’ll explore some of the most important properties of the Fourier transform. These properties aren’t just mathematical curiosities — they’re practical tools used in signal processing, imaging, and many other fields.

After that, in Section 3, we’ll extend our thinking to higher dimensions. I’ll show you how the Fourier transform applies not just to one-dimensional signals, but also to images — and beyond. I’ll even walk you through an example where converting an image to the Fourier domain makes it easy to remove noise.

Finally, in Section 4, we’ll wrap things up with a few remarks and reflections.

So by the end of this lecture, you should not only understand the mathematical structure of the Fourier transform, but also see its real-world value, especially in areas like medical imaging.
Let’s get started with the first section: the derivation of the Fourier transform.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

10,"You’ve actually seen this slide before — it’s a summary of what we covered in the last lecture, and now it serves as our starting point for deriving the Fourier transform.

Let’s quickly revisit the main idea:
We said that any arbitrary function can be treated as if it were periodic, defined over a fixed interval. In this case, we’re looking at a symmetric interval — from minus capital T over 2 to plus capital T over 2.

Within this interval, we can represent the function f of t as a sum of sinusoidal components — specifically, complex exponentials of the form:
e to the power i times 2 pi n, times t over T.
This is a compact way to write sine and cosine waves using Euler’s formula. So even though the expression looks complex, it represents a mix of sine and cosine waves at various frequencies, where n runs from minus infinity to plus infinity.
And just like before, each component has a corresponding coefficient, which tells us how much of that wave appears in the overall function.

To compute the coefficient c n, we use the formula at the bottom:
c n equals 1 over capital T, times the integral from minus T over 2 to T over 2, of e to the minus i 2 pi n t over T, times f of t, with respect to t.
This is just an inner product — projecting f of t onto a complex exponential basis function. That projection gives us the weight, or the contribution, of that particular frequency.

So, this slide wraps up all the key ideas from the Fourier series — including:
Treating functions as periodic,
Expressing them with complex exponentials,
And computing coefficients through integration.
With this solid foundation in place, we’re now ready to take the next step — and derive the Fourier transform, which generalizes everything we’ve done so far.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
11,"Alright — now let’s take the next step together.
Earlier, we learned how to calculate the Fourier coefficient c n for a function with arbitrary period T. Now, we’re going to insert that expression for c n directly into the Fourier series formula.

What happens when we do that?
Well, here’s what we get: we take the formula for c n — which is an integral — and plug it into the sum. So now, each term in the series contains an inner product multiplied by a complex exponential.

Notice this part out front: 1 over capital T. This shows up because we’re working over a general period T, not the unit interval. So we need to normalize — or average — over the full interval from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2.
This 1 over T acts like a scaling factor — a way of balancing the sum so that everything works out correctly.
Now look inside the brackets. What we’re really doing here is taking the inner product of two functions:
One is f of t,
And the other is the complex exponential e to the power minus i 2 pi n t over T.

You multiply them together point by point, and then integrate over the interval. That’s what we mean by an inner product in this context.
And we’re doing this for many values of n, both negative and positive. So you can imagine we’re computing inner products at a whole series of frequency points — where each frequency is n divided by T.

As T becomes large, the spacing between these frequencies — that is, the difference between one n over T and the next — becomes smaller and smaller. Eventually, this sum will start to resemble an integral over a continuous range of frequencies, and that’s the key idea behind the Fourier transform.

So, to summarize:We’re inserting the formula for c n, and that gives us a series of inner products across many frequencies, with a spacing of delta u equals 1 over T. This step sets us up perfectly to move from a discrete sum to a continuous integral — which is what the Fourier transform is all about.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
12,"Now to understand that last idea more clearly, let’s take a look at this picture.

What we’re doing here is sampling inner products at many frequency points. Each of these points corresponds to a value of n divided by capital T — that is, u equals n over T. As n varies from negative to positive integers, you get a collection of frequency points spread along the u-axis, which represents frequency.

When n equals 0, you’re at the DC component — the zero-frequency term. When n equals 1, you get one frequency point. When n equals minus 1, you get another. And so on.
So you can imagine each vertical line here as one of those frequency points — u equals n over T — spread across the axis.

Now here’s the key idea:If we let the period T become very large, then the range from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2 will grow wider and wider. In fact, in the limit as T goes to infinity, that interval covers the entire frequency axis — from minus infinity to plus infinity.

That’s what we mean by dense sampling of frequency.
As T increases, the spacing between neighboring frequencies gets smaller and smaller. Mathematically, the spacing — which we call delta u — becomes 1 over capital T. So the gap between u equals to n over T and u equals to (n plus 1) over T shrinks.
Eventually, these discrete frequency samples get so close together that they begin to form a continuous spectrum.
And that’s the magic.

We started with a periodic function, which gives us discrete frequencies. But as the period stretches toward infinity, the function becomes non-periodic, and the discrete frequency points turn into a continuous frequency range.
So, what is a non-periodic function in this view?
It’s just a periodic function with an infinitely long period. Anything that happens beyond that infinite window doesn’t affect what we see — and that’s how we bridge from the Fourier series to the Fourier transform.

This slide captures the big picture:
Discrete frequencies spaced by 1 over T,
Becoming densely packed as T increases,
And ultimately forming a continuous frequency axis.
That’s our gateway into the Fourier transform.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
13,"Alright — this slide is the heart of the lecture. Take a moment to follow this carefully, because here is where we formally derive the Fourier transform — and also see how we can recover the original function using the inverse transform.

Let’s begin at the top.
We’re starting with our expression for f of t, written as a Fourier series. We substitute the expression for c over n — the Fourier coefficient — right into this formula.

Now remember, c over n contains an integral — and it includes a 1 over T term out front. Since T is constant, we pull it out of the sum.
At this point, we apply a key idea we introduced earlier:Let T become very large, so large that we’re effectively dealing with a non-periodic function. When T approaches infinity, the spacing between the frequency samples, delta u equals to 1 over T, becomes tiny — almost zero.

So what happens?
Instead of summing over discrete frequencies, we move to a continuous frequency variable, which we call u — where u equals n divided by T.
This transition lets us replace the sum with an integral.
So now we’ve gone from a sum of discrete terms to an integral over a continuous range of frequencies. The inner product becomes f-hat of u, the Fourier transform of f of t. And the exponential term becomes e to the power i 2 pi u t — our new kernel in the transform.

Let’s pause here and look at the final expression.
You’ll notice two things:
First, to compute f-hat of u, the Fourier transform, we integrate f of t multiplied by e to the minus i 2 pi u t. That’s the forward transform — moving from the time domain to the frequency domain.
Second, to reconstruct f of t, we take f-hat of u, multiply it by e to the power i 2 pi u t, and integrate over all u. That’s the inverse transform — bringing us back from frequency to time.
So these two formulas — the forward and inverse transforms — are the foundation of the Fourier transform.

They let us take a non-periodic function and decompose it into a continuous spectrum of frequencies. And then, using that spectrum, we can reconstruct the original function with complete accuracy.
This is what makes the Fourier transform so powerful — not just mathematically, but also practically — in fields like signal processing, image analysis, and, of course, medical imaging.
From this point forward, we’re now working with non-periodic functions, and we’ve fully transitioned from Fourier series to the Fourier transform.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
14,"Now let’s bring things down to earth a bit and look at a concrete example — something visual, something simple.
This function right here is called the rectangular function, or sometimes the gate function. You’ll also see it written as pi of t.
And as you can see from the graph — it really does look like a gate.

Let’s break it down:
The value of the function is 1 when the absolute value of t is less than one-half — that is, between minus one-half and plus one-half.
Outside that interval, the function drops to zero.
So, the entire “on” region is one unit wide, and the height is 1, which means the area under the curve is also 1.
This function is simple, but it’s also very important — and we’re going to use it often in later examples.

Now here’s the key point:This is a non-periodic function.
And back when we only had Fourier series — which apply to periodic functions — we couldn’t directly express this kind of shape using sines and cosines.
But now, thanks to the Fourier transform, we can.

We’re no longer limited to repeating signals. We can now handle functions like this — compact, finite, non-repeating — and still express them in terms of sinusoidal components, just over a continuous range of frequencies.
So this rectangular function — although it’s simple — gives us a great opportunity to visualize the power of the Fourier transform.
Let’s keep going and see what it looks like in the frequency domain.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
15,"Now let’s do something clever.

We just looked at the gate function, or rectangular function, which is not periodic. And because it’s non-periodic, we can't represent it using a Fourier series — only the Fourier transform works in that case.
But what if we wanted to use Fourier series?Well — we can! We just need to make the function periodic.
And here’s how we do it: we take that single gate function — and simply repeat it over and over again, at regular intervals. This is called periodization.

In this slide, the original gate function is being repeated with a period of 16. So now you’ve got a train of rectangular pulses, equally spaced along the time axis.
Visually, you can think of it like flipping a light switch on for a second — and then leaving it off for a long time — then flipping it on again — and repeating that process over and over.
The key is: now we’ve created a periodic signal.
And because it’s periodic, we can now apply Fourier series to analyze it — just like we did before.

All you need to do is plug this periodic function into the Fourier series formulas, and you’ll get a representation as a sum of sine and cosine waves — or complex exponentials.
This kind of construction is very useful. In fact, it shows up in engineering and physics quite a bit — especially in systems that switch on and off repeatedly. Sometimes you’ll hear people talk about the duty cycle, which refers to how much of each period the function is “on” versus “off.”

So again — by making the function periodic, we unlock the power of the Fourier series.
And soon, we’ll compare this with what happens when we go back to the non-periodic version, and apply the Fourier transform instead.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
16,"Now, let’s visualize the powerful idea we’ve been building toward — how we move from Fourier series to the Fourier transform.
What you see here is the frequency-domain representation of the rectangular function as we increase the period of its periodic extension.
Let’s start at the top left.
These vertical lines represent the Fourier coefficients — discrete spikes at different frequency points. These are the outputs of the Fourier series.
You’ve got:
A DC component at zero frequency,
The first harmonic,
The second harmonic, and so on.
Each coefficient is calculated using the formulas we saw earlier. And because the original function is real-valued, these coefficients appear symmetrically around zero when using the complex form.

Now — here’s the trick:We begin to increase the period T of the function.
That means we’re spacing the rectangular pulses farther apart in the time domain. And in the frequency domain, this has a very important effect:The spacing between the Fourier components, which is 1 over T, becomes smaller and smaller.
You can see this happening in the middle image — the spikes begin to cluster more tightly. The frequency axis, labeled u equals n divided by T, gets more densely sampled.
And as we continue increasing T — moving to the bottom image — the spacing becomes infinitesimally small. At this point, we’re no longer looking at a discrete spectrum. We now have a continuous curve.
That’s the moment when we’ve transitioned from the Fourier series to the Fourier transform.

So here’s the big picture:
When a function is periodic, we get a discrete Fourier spectrum.
But when the function becomes non-periodic, by letting the period go to infinity, we end up with a continuous Fourier spectrum.
This spectrum is smooth and continuous — and it tells us how much of each frequency exists in the original signal.
So this slide gives us the geometrical insight — the visual transition — from the world of periodic signals and discrete spectra, to the world of non-periodic signals and continuous spectra.
And this is what the Fourier transform captures so beautifully.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
17,"Now that we’ve built up all the ideas step by step, let’s bring it all together into one elegant concept — the Fourier transform pair.
What you see on this slide captures the very heart of Fourier analysis.

Let’s begin with the first equation, which is the forward Fourier transform.Suppose you have a signal in the time domain, which we’ll call f of t. The goal is to understand how much of each frequency is present in that signal.

So how do we do that?
We project f of t onto a family of complex exponential functions. These functions look like e to the power minus i, 2 pi, u, t, where u is the frequency. This projection acts like an inner product, telling us how strongly f of t resonates with each frequency component.
When we integrate this product across all time, we obtain f hat of u, also called the frequency spectrum or the Fourier transform of f of t.
So this first equation maps the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain.

Now look at the second equation. This is the inverse Fourier transform.
Here, we take all those frequency components — that is, each f hat of u — and multiply them by their corresponding complex exponential, this time e to the power i, two pi, u, t. Then, we integrate over all frequencies.
And what do we get?We reconstruct the original signal — f of t — exactly.
So in summary, the forward transform takes you from time to frequency, and the inverse transform brings you back from frequency to time.That’s the two-way mapping shown symbolically at the bottom:f of t goes to f hat of u, and back again.

Now, a few mathematical notes to make this complete:
First — this transform assumes that f of t is square-integrable, meaning if you square the function and integrate it over all time, the total is finite. This ensures convergence and makes the math work properly.

Second — even though we’re dealing with a non-periodic function here, the idea still grows out of the Fourier series. Remember what happens when the period of a function becomes very large — the discrete set of frequency components becomes a continuous spectrum. The Fourier transform is essentially the limit of the Fourier series as the period tends to infinity.
And finally — here’s a nice geometric interpretation.
Think of projecting a 3D vector onto the x, y, and z axes.
In the same way, when we apply the Fourier transform, we’re projecting our function onto an infinite set of sine and cosine waves — or more precisely, complex exponentials. Each frequency contributes a tiny slice of the original signal.And by adding all those slices back together — using integration — we reconstruct the full signal.

This isn’t just a clever trick.It’s one of the most powerful tools in all of engineering, physics, and mathematics.It lets us analyze and manipulate signals in both time and frequency — without losing any information.
With this foundational concept in place, we’re ready to explore some practical examples and dive deeper into the properties of the Fourier transform.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
18,"Let’s go through a concrete example — the Fourier transform of the gate function, also called the rectangular function.
We’ve already seen this function earlier. It’s a flat function that equals 1 when the time variable t is between minus one-half and plus one-half, and it’s zero everywhere else. So it looks like a rectangle centered at zero.

Now, we want to find its Fourier transform. To do that, we apply the definition.
We take the integral of the original function multiplied by a complex exponential — that’s e to the power negative i 2 pi u t — and we integrate over all time.

But since the gate function is zero outside the interval from minus one-half to plus one-half, we only need to integrate over that range.
So the integral becomes: from minus one-half to plus one-half of e to the negative i 2 pi u t, with respect to t.
This is a standard exponential integral. When you solve it, you get the function sine of pi u, divided by pi u.
This result is known as the sinc function and it shows up everywhere in signal processing and imaging.
So here’s what we’ve found: a rectangle in time turns into a sinc wave in frequency. That’s a beautiful and very useful result.

Now, what if we stretch the gate to make it wider?
Let’s say the gate equals 1 from minus capital T over 2 to plus T over 2, and zero elsewhere. Then the Fourier transform becomes a scaled version of the same sinc function — it just shrinks or stretches based on the value of T.
So you could try computing it directly, or you could use a shortcut — the scaling property of the Fourier transform, which we’ll talk about soon.

But the key point is this: the rectangular function in time gives us a sinc function in frequency.
And here’s one final note. You might wonder what happens when u equals zero, because both the top and bottom become zero. But don’t worry — if you take the limit using calculus, it turns out the value is exactly 1. So the function is smooth at the center.
We’ll use this gate-to-sinc pair often, so keep it in mind as we move forward.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
19,"Now let’s take a look at the actual shape of the sinc function — the one we just derived from the rectangular gate.

What you see here is the graph of that function — sinc of u — which is defined as sine of pi times u, divided by pi times u.
It has a smooth, wave-like shape. The peak is right at the center — at u equals zero — and the height there is exactly 1.
As you move away from the center in either direction, the function oscillates — it goes up and down — but the peaks get smaller and smaller.
That’s because the sine wave in the numerator keeps swinging, but the denominator grows, so the overall value shrinks.
This is the signature look of the sinc function — one strong central lobe and then smaller and smaller ripples on the sides.

So this is the frequency domain representation of a simple gate in time.
And just to recap — this sinc function came from a rectangular gate function of width 1.
If we use a wider gate — let’s say the width is capital T instead of 1 — then the sinc function would stretch out horizontally. That is, the ripples would become narrower in frequency, because time and frequency are inversely related.

We’ll explore that in more detail when we talk about the scaling property. But for now, just remember: a narrow gate in time gives a wide sinc in frequency. A wide gate in time gives a narrow sinc.
This is a key idea we’ll return to again and again.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

20,"Now let’s move on to our second example — the triangle function.

This function, often called the triangular function, is shaped just like its name suggests — a triangle. It peaks at 1 when x equals 0, and then it decreases linearly to zero as x moves out to minus 1 and plus 1. Outside of that range, the value is zero.

Mathematically, it’s defined like this: one minus the absolute value of x when x is between negative 1 and 1, and zero otherwise.
So what we want to do now is find its Fourier transform.

In other words, we want to express this smooth, non-periodic triangular function as a combination of infinitely many sinusoidal waves — just like we did with the gate function.

We’ll add up all these waves — each with a different frequency and amplitude — and by doing so, we’ll be able to reconstruct this triangle shape exactly.
That’s the idea behind Fourier transform: take a function, no matter how it looks, and rewrite it as a sum of wave components. Each component carries part of the shape — and when you combine them all, you get the original back.
Let’s see what that looks like in this case.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
21,"Let’s now take a look at the result of the Fourier transform of the triangle function.

If we go through the steps — plugging the triangle function into the Fourier transform formula and carrying out the integration — we end up with a very elegant result. The Fourier transform turns out to be the square of the sinc function.
That is, we get sinc squared.

You might remember that the Fourier transform of the gate function gave us a sinc function. So this result — sinc squared — is not just a coincidence.
There’s actually a deeper reason behind it.
It’s related to an operation called convolution. We saw this in the context of the Fourier series, and we’ll explore it again in more depth when we talk about properties of the Fourier transform.

But the key takeaway here is this: the triangle function is, in a way, the convolution of two gate functions. And in the frequency domain, convolution in time corresponds to multiplication in frequency. That’s why the sinc function — from the gate — becomes sinc squared for the triangle.

And down at the bottom, we can see the graph of sinc squared. It has the same overall shape as sinc — a central peak and decaying ripples — but now the oscillations are all positive and fall off more smoothly.
So, this example shows another beautiful connection between shapes in the time domain and their patterns in the frequency domain.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
22,"Let’s now take a look at a few more examples of Fourier transform pairs — some of them elegant, some of them a bit more abstract.

First, we have the Gaussian function. In the time domain, it’s written as e to the power negative pi t squared. This is the familiar bell-shaped curve — smooth, centered, and decaying quickly. What’s remarkable is that its Fourier transform is also a Gaussian — e to the power negative pi u squared. The shape stays the same, just transformed into the frequency domain. The Gaussian is one of the few functions that’s unchanged, except for scaling — we say it’s self-Fourier.

Next, let’s consider a constant function — just a flat value c across time. Now, technically this function is not square-integrable, meaning we can’t just apply the Fourier transform in the usual way. But in a generalized sense, we can still assign it a meaning. And it turns out the Fourier transform of a constant is a scaled delta function — specifically, c times delta of u. This makes intuitive sense: a constant signal has no frequency variation, so all its energy is concentrated at zero frequency.

And finally, look at this interesting example: the shifted delta function delta of t minus a. If you perform the Fourier transform of this, you get a complex exponential — e to the power minus i 2 pi a u. This tells us that shifting a delta function in time introduces a phase shift in frequency. And that phase shift depends on the amount of translation — the value a — and also on the frequency u.

Now, I should point out — when you’re working with generalized functions like constants and delta functions, the usual rules don’t always apply directly. These are not square-integrable functions. So we use the tools of distribution theory to handle them more rigorously. If you’re curious, I explain this in more detail in the book chapter.

But for now, just keep in mind — even with these edge cases, the idea of expressing a signal in terms of wave components still holds.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
23,"Now that we’ve gone through several examples, let’s take a moment to highlight some core properties of the Fourier transform — the features that make it such a powerful and elegant analytical tool.

We begin with linearity. If you combine two functions, say f and g, using constants a and b — meaning you form ""a times f plus b times g"" — then the Fourier transform of that sum is simply ""a times the transform of f plus b times the transform of g."" This reflects the principle of superposition, which is central to all linear systems.

Next is the time-shifting property. If you shift a function in time — let’s say you move it by x naught — then in the frequency domain, the transform stays the same in shape but gets multiplied by a complex exponential factor. Specifically, it’s multiplied by e to the power minus i 2 pi x naught u. So shifting in time introduces a phase shift in frequency.

Now let’s flip that idea — this is called modulation. If you multiply a function in the time domain by a complex exponential, then you shift its frequency content. So time-domain modulation causes a translation in the frequency domain.

Another important concept is scaling. If you compress or stretch a function in time — say, you use f of a t — then the frequency representation stretches or compresses in the opposite way. And the result is scaled by one over the absolute value of a. So if the time signal gets narrower, the spectrum spreads out.

We also have conjugation. If you take the complex conjugate of a function, then its Fourier transform reflects across the frequency axis — that is, the transform at minus u becomes the conjugate of the transform at u.
And finally, if the original function is real-valued, its Fourier transform has Hermitian symmetry. That means the spectrum is symmetric in a complex-conjugate sense.

Each of these properties gives us deeper insight into how signals behave across time and frequency. We’ll explore them in more detail as we continue — but for now, keep these tools in mind. They’ll help you decode and design systems with much greater clarity.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

24,"Let's look into more detail. Okay, the first linearity. So this is just, again, this part copied from the Stanford textbook. So you have a function f and g. 

There are Fourier transformations. So you have Fourier transformation. You have this summation, the summation of the original function. 
Then you perform Fourier transformation. The result is the same as the summation of the Fourier transformation of f and the Fourier transformation of g. So this is additivity. So in the system, linear system lecture, we explain that. 

How about the scaling or homogeneity? So if f is scaled by alpha, then we perform Fourier transform. That's the same as performing the Fourier transform of f. Then you scale the result by the same scaling factor. So you can verify these two properties according to the formula by defining the Fourier transform. So you can just see here, just as an example, you show additivity. And you can similarly show the scaling property.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

25,"Now let’s look at another important idea in Fourier analysis — the shift property, also called the translation property.

This property explains what happens when we shift a function in time. Suppose we have a function, f of t, and we shift it by some constant b. That means our new function is f of t minus b. So what happens to its Fourier transform?
The answer is: the shape of the spectrum stays the same, but we multiply it by a phase factor. Specifically, we multiply it by e to the power minus 2 pi i s b. In other words, shifting the function in time causes a rotation in the phase of the frequency spectrum.

Let’s go through why that’s true.
We start with the definition of the Fourier transform of f of t minus b. Inside the integral, we make a substitution: we let u equal t minus b. That’s just a change of variable — and it doesn’t affect the limits of the integral, which still go from negative infinity to positive infinity.

Now, when we rewrite the integral in terms of u, something interesting happens. The exponential term splits into two parts. One part depends on u, and the other depends on b. The part with b is just a constant, so we can pull it outside the integral.
What remains inside is the same integral we started with — the Fourier transform of the original function, f of t.
So in the end, we have the original spectrum, multiplied by this exponential phase term.

That’s the core idea of the shift property:When you shift a function in time, it introduces a phase shift in the frequency domain.
This is an extremely useful result when working with signals that are delayed or moved in time — it tells you exactly how the spectrum changes, and helps preserve the full mathematical relationship between time and frequency.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:

26,"Let’s take a closer look at the scaling property of the Fourier transform.
Here’s the idea. Suppose we have a function, f of t. And now, instead of f of t, we look at f of a times t, where a is just some constant — not zero.

We’re changing the time scale. The question is: what happens to its Fourier transform?
Well, this depends on whether a is positive or negative. But in both cases, something interesting happens.
First, let’s say a is greater than zero.
We plug f of a t into the Fourier transform formula. If you do the math — which involves changing variables and rearranging terms — you end up with this:
The Fourier transform of f of a t becomesone divided by a, times F of s divided by a.

So what does that mean?
If we stretch the function in time — that is, make it slower — its frequency content gets compressed.And if we squeeze it in time — make it faster — the frequency content stretches out.

Now, what if a is less than zero?
In that case, the same formula still works, but with a minus sign that comes from flipping the limits of integration.

So we just take the absolute value of a, and the final result becomes:
The Fourier transform of f of a t equalsone over the absolute value of a, times F of s over a.

So in short:Scaling in time causes the opposite effect in frequency.That’s the scaling property.
And this is one more way to see how time and frequency are tightly connected in the Fourier world.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

27,"So now, let’s bring this scaling idea to life with a visual example.

Take a look at the top plot. This shows different versions of a triangular function — blue, orange, and green. They all have the same shape, but different widths.
The blue triangle is the narrowest.The orange one is a little wider.And the green one is the widest of all.
Now, let’s look at what happens in the frequency domain — shown in the bottom plot.

Here’s the key idea:When the function gets wider in time, its frequency content gets narrower.
You can see that clearly:
The narrow blue triangle has the widest Fourier transform — that’s the blue curve in the bottom plot.
The medium-width orange triangle gives a more focused frequency response — that’s the orange curve.
And the wide green triangle gives a sharp, tall peak in the frequency domain — the green curve below.
This is the heart of the scaling property.Wider in time means tighter in frequency, and vice versa.

It’s a kind of duality — as if time and frequency are pulling on opposite ends of a rope.
And as a special case, if you use a delta function — which is infinitely narrow in time — its Fourier transform becomes perfectly flat, spread across all frequencies.
On the other hand, a Gaussian function is balanced — it’s the only shape where both the time and frequency profiles remain Gaussian.
So visually, scaling is not just a math trick — it’s a powerful way to understand how functions behave in both domains.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

28,"Now let’s talk about a beautiful and surprising property of the Fourier transform — its connection to derivatives.
Suppose we start with a function, f of t, and its Fourier transform is capital F of s.

Now you might ask:What happens if we take the derivative of f — that is, f prime of t — and then perform the Fourier transform?
The answer is elegant:Taking a derivative in time becomes multiplication in the frequency domain.

More precisely,The Fourier transform of f ' of t is just 2 pi i s times the Fourier transform of f.So again, taking a derivative becomes a simple multiplication — and the factor depends on frequency.
There’s also a second version of this rule:If you take the derivative of the Fourier transform itself with respect to s,That’s the same as applying -2 pi i t to f of t — and then transforming it.

So in summary:
Derivatives in one domain correspond to multiplications in the other domain.
And this duality works both ways — from time to frequency, or frequency to time.
This relationship is incredibly useful in practice, especially in physics and engineering, where differentiation often pops up in systems and signals.

And best of all, it’s not magic — you can prove this directly from the Fourier transform formula, just by carefully taking the derivative under the integral.

29,"Now here's one of the most important Fourier transform pairs — the impulse train, also called the comb function.
Think of it this way:
We place delta functions at evenly spaced intervals — for example, every delta t along the time axis.This gives us a repeating sequence of sharp spikes — like the teeth of a comb — so we call it a comb function in time.
Mathematically, we write this as the sum of delta of t minus n delta t, summed over all integers n.That just means we have delta functions at 0, at delta t, at 2 delta t, and so on, going both directions.

Now here’s the key:When we take the Fourier transform of this comb in time, what do we get?
Surprisingly, we get another comb — this time in the frequency domain.But the spacing changes — instead of delta t, the spikes are now spaced by 1 over delta t.
So if we sample more tightly in time, the frequency comb spreads out.And if we stretch out the spacing in time, the frequency spikes get closer together.
This is exactly the scaling property we saw earlier — a tight structure in one domain leads to a broad structure in the other.

Now you might be wondering — how do we handle all these delta functions?They’re not ordinary functions — they’re distributions or generalized functions.And we’re dealing with an infinite sum of them.
This touches on deeper mathematics — involving convergence and rigor — but for our purposes, this formula holds and is extremely useful.We’ll come back to this paired comb concept again in the next lecture, especially when we talk about sampling theory and the Fourier series.

So just remember:A comb in time transforms to a comb in frequency.And their spacing is inversely related — one over the other.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

30,"Let’s now talk about one of the most powerful tools in the Fourier world — the convolution theorem.

In plain terms, the convolution theorem says this:
Convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain.

Let me say that again, but clearly:If you have two functions — let’s call them f of t and g of t — and you convolve them together, then their Fourier transform is simply the product of their individual transforms.
So:If the Fourier transform of f of t is capital F of s,and the transform of g of t is capital G of s,then the transform of f convolved with g is F of s times G of s.
That’s the core idea.

Now why does this matter?
Because convolution — though useful — is often hard to compute directly.It involves flipping one function, shifting it, multiplying, and integrating. That’s a lot of work!
But thanks to this theorem, we can skip all that.Instead, we go to the frequency domain, multiply two functions — much simpler — and then just come back to the time domain using an inverse transform.

Let’s walk through a concrete example.
Think about a gate function — also called a rectangular pulse. Its Fourier transform is a sinc function — which looks like a smooth wave with side ripples.
Now, if we take two gate functions and convolve them in time, we get a triangle function.

So what happens in the frequency domain?
Each gate becomes a sinc function. When we multiply the two sinc functions together, we get sinc squared.
That is — sinc of s times sinc of s gives you sinc squared of s.

So the triangle function — which was a convolution of two gates — has a Fourier transform equal to sinc squared.
That’s a beautiful result, and it all comes from the convolution theorem.
It also shows how Fourier analysis turns complicated operations into simpler ones, especially in engineering, signal processing, and physics.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

31,"Now let’s take a moment to understand why the convolution theorem actually works. What’s the reasoning behind it?
So far, we've seen that the Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions — say, f of t and g of t — turns into a simple multiplication of their individual transforms. 

But why is that true?
Let’s walk through the logic behind it, one step at a time.
We start with this:Multiply the Fourier transform of f of t by the Fourier transform of g of t. That means you're multiplying two integrals. One for g of t times a complex exponential, and the other for f of x times the same kind of exponential — but with a different variable.
To combine them, we use different dummy variables inside the integrals — like t in one and x in the other — so they don't interfere. Then we combine them into a double integral.

Now we group the exponential terms. The two exponentials become a single exponential with t plus x in the exponent.
This sets up our key trick: we change variables. In the inner integral, let’s sayu equals t plus x. That means t equals u minus x, and since we're just changing variables inside an integral, the limits stay the same.
So now, what used to be g of t becomes g of u minus x, and the exponential becomes a function of u. This lets us express the entire inside of the integral in terms of u, and f of x stays outside.
At this point, we switch the order of integration — that’s allowed because the functions we’re working with are well-behaved. So now we’re integrating over u, with x nested inside.

What you get in the end is this:You have e to the power minus 2 pi i s  u — that’s the same complex exponential from the Fourier formula — and it’s multiplied by the convolution of g and f at position u.
That’s the key. The inner integral has now become the convolution of g and f, evaluated at u.
So finally, this whole thing is just the Fourier transform of that convolution.
That’s the magic of it.
Multiplication in the Fourier domain really does correspond to convolution in the time domain — and now you’ve seen where it comes from.
Of course, these steps are dense, and I encourage you to go over them again slowly. Grab a coffee, sit back, and follow the substitutions. Each step follows cleanly from the last — and the full picture is quite elegant.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

32,"So let’s take a step back and ask—why is convolution in the time domain equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain?

To understand this, let’s think about a shift-invariant linear system. If you feed a sinusoidal signal into such a system, the output will also be sinusoidal. And—here’s the key—it will be at the same frequency. The system might change the amplitude or the phase, but it doesn’t generate new frequencies. That’s the hallmark of a shift-invariant, or time-invariant, linear system.
This leads to a deep and beautiful conclusion. If sinusoidal signals are preserved in shape and frequency, then the effect of the system on each frequency component can be described by a single number—just a scaling factor that depends on frequency.

So, imagine you take any general signal, and you decompose it into a sum of sinusoidal components. The system acts on each component individually, scaling each one by a different amount. That’s exactly what multiplication looks like in the Fourier domain. Each frequency is being multiplied by its own gain factor.
That’s why convolution in the time domain turns into multiplication in the frequency domain.

Now, here's something important: this only works because of that special property of sinusoids. Among all functions, only sinusoids maintain their shape when passing through a shift-invariant linear system. Delta functions, for instance, don’t behave that way—they get transformed into something entirely different. But a cosine remains a cosine. A sine remains a sine. Just possibly scaled or phase-shifted.
And this is what makes the Fourier transform so unique. It’s the only transform for which the convolution theorem holds—because only sinusoids have this invariance.

You might wonder—could we define a similar convolution theorem using other transforms, like wavelet transforms or Hadamard transforms? The answer is no. Those basis functions don’t have this shape-preserving property under linear shift-invariant systems. So the convolution theorem doesn’t hold for them.

Now if you’re curious, you can actually find some advanced papers on this. Try searching for “characterization of the convolution theorem.” You’ll find rigorous mathematical proofs that ultimately say the same thing: the convolution theorem is special to the Fourier transform.
But you don’t need pages of math to get the intuition. If a function keeps its shape through a system, and we can describe the system’s effect with a frequency-dependent multiplier, then that’s multiplication in the Fourier domain.
And if you're passionate about the math behind this, you could even write a short paper exploring this idea. I'd be happy to discuss it with you.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

33,"Now let’s talk about another important result in Fourier analysis — Parseval’s Identity.

This identity says that the total energy of a signal, when measured in the time domain, is exactly equal to the total energy in the frequency domain. Mathematically, it's written as:the integral of the square of the function f of t over all time, equals the integral of the square of its Fourier transform — f hat of s — over all frequencies.
Let me give you some intuition here.

Suppose you have a function, maybe it’s an electric signal or a sound wave. In the time domain, the quantity f of t squared represents the power of that signal at each instant. When you integrate this over time, you’re summing up all that power — you get the total energy.
Now, that same signal can be broken down into its frequency components using the Fourier transform. In that domain, each component has an amplitude, and squaring that amplitude gives you the energy associated with that frequency. Integrating over all frequencies gives you the total energy — again.

So Parseval’s Identity tells us something very beautiful: energy is conserved between the time domain and the frequency domain.
This has a strong connection to what you learned in physics. Think about alternating current. If you have a sinusoidal current flowing through a resistor, the instantaneous power is proportional to the current squared. And when you integrate that over time, you get the total energy consumed by the resistor.

Now, from a geometric perspective, you can think of f of t as a vector in an infinite-dimensional space. That sounds abstract, but it’s just like a regular vector — except with infinitely many components. And the length of this vector is found by summing up the square of each component — just like in ordinary geometry.

The Fourier transform is a kind of coordinate transformation — like a rotation of the space. So when we go from the time domain to the frequency domain, we’re rotating the vector. But that doesn’t change its length. So geometrically, Parseval’s Identity simply says: the length of the signal vector is preserved under the Fourier transform.
You can also prove this identity using standard calculus and the definition of the Fourier transform. And yes, that’s a good exercise. But I want you to also grasp the meaning behind it.

So next time you see this identity, remember — it’s not just a formula. It tells you that energy, or vector length, is preserved when moving between the time and frequency domains. And that is both physically and mathematically very powerful.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

34,"So far, we’ve been talking about transformations in one dimension — mainly between time and frequency using the Fourier transform. But to truly understand what's going on, it helps to think geometrically.
Let’s start with something more familiar — a simple two-dimensional rotation.

Imagine we have a point in the 2D plane, described by coordinates x and y in a standard X Y coordinate system. Now, suppose we want to express this same point in a new coordinate system, X-prime and Y-prime, which is rotated by some angle phi from the original axes.
As the diagram shows, the new coordinates — x-prime and y-prime — can be computed from the original ones using the rotation formulas.

So x-prime equals x times cosine phi plus y times sine phi,and y-prime equals negative x times sine phi plus y times cosine phi.
You can also write this transformation in matrix form. It’s a simple 2-by-2 rotation matrix.
Now why is this relevant?

Because this kind of rotation is a basic example of an orthonormal transformation, just like the Fourier transform. When we rotate the coordinate system, we’re not changing the length of the vector — we’re just viewing it from a different angle. The structure stays the same, just expressed differently.

This gives us a visual and intuitive way to think about more abstract transformations. In higher dimensions — or even infinite dimensions — the concept is similar. We’re taking a function, representing it in a new coordinate system, and the transformation preserves important properties like length and energy.

That’s why understanding this simple 2D rotation helps us better appreciate what the Fourier transform is doing. It’s not magic — it’s geometry, just in a much bigger space.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

35,"Now that we understand the Fourier transform in one dimension, let’s take it a step further — to two dimensions.

Just like in the 1D case, the idea is to take a function — in this case, a function of two variables, x and y — and express it in terms of its frequency content. But instead of waves traveling along a line, now we’re dealing with wave patterns that extend in all directions across a plane.

The 2D Fourier transform lets us analyze how these wave components — traveling in the x direction, the y direction, or even diagonally — contribute to the overall structure of the signal or image.
The formula here tells us how to compute the 2D Fourier transform. The function f of x and y is transformed into capital F of u and v, where u and v represent the spatial frequencies in the horizontal and vertical directions.
And just like before, there’s an inverse formula that lets us go back from the frequency domain to the original spatial domain.
Now, why is this so useful?

Because in many real-world applications — like medical imaging, computer vision, or signal processing — we deal with 2D data. Think of an image, for example. Each pixel represents a value at some x and y location. When we apply the 2D Fourier transform, we can analyze the texture, orientation, and frequency content of that image.

On the left side of the slide, we see a simple geometric object — like a bar. On the right is its 2D Fourier spectrum. Notice how the orientation of the object affects the direction of the frequency response.

36,"Let’s now look at a powerful application of the 2D Fourier transform — noise suppression.
Take a look at the image on the left. It’s a noisy version of a familiar test image — lots of random graininess, especially in the background and darker areas.

Now, if we perform a 2D Fourier transform — which we indicate here by ""F T"" — we move from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. The result is this bottom-left image, which shows the frequency spectrum of the noisy image.
Notice something important: most of the meaningful image information is concentrated around the center, which corresponds to the low-frequency components. But the noise is spread out — especially toward the edges — as high-frequency speckles.
And this gives us an idea.

What if we simply suppress or remove those high-frequency components? That’s what we’re doing on the bottom-right: we apply a mask — setting the noisy high-frequency regions to zero, while keeping only the central, low-frequency region.

Then we perform the inverse Fourier transform — marked here as ""I F T"" — to convert back to the spatial domain.
And just like that, we get a much cleaner version of the original image. Most of the noise is gone, and the essential structure is preserved.
This is one of the key strengths of working in the frequency domain. Certain operations — like filtering or noise removal — can be done more easily, more effectively, and sometimes more intuitively after transformation.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

37,"Let’s take this a step further and look at low-pass and high-pass filtering using the Fourier transform.

Start with the image on the far left — this is our original image of a building. Below it, you see the corresponding frequency spectrum. It contains both low-frequency components, which encode smooth variations like brightness and shading, and high-frequency components, which capture edges and fine details.

Now look at the middle column.
Here, we’ve applied a low-pass filter. That means we kept only the low-frequency components — those near the center of the Fourier spectrum — and removed the rest. You can see the filtered spectrum just below. The result, shown in the middle image above, is a smoothed version of the original — the fine details are gone, and only the broad, soft structures remain.

Next, we move to the rightmost column.
This time we’ve done the opposite. We removed the low frequencies and kept only a selected band of high-frequency components. You can see that in the frequency plot — a ring where the center is zeroed out. The corresponding spatial image above now reveals only the edges — the sharp transitions in intensity.
So by simply choosing which frequency bands to preserve or remove, we can control the kind of information we keep — soft versus sharp, background versus boundary.

This is another powerful reason why we often work in the frequency domain — filtering becomes intuitive and flexible.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

38,"Let’s now walk through an important example: the two-dimensional rectangle function, centered at the origin, with side lengths X and Y.

This function is quite simple in the spatial domain — it's just a bright rectangular block surrounded by zeros. But when we take its 2D Fourier transform, something fascinating happens.
The resulting function in the frequency domain is a product of two sinc functions — one in the u direction and one in the v direction. And remember, sinc functions come from the Fourier transform of a box function in one dimension. So when we go to two dimensions, the result is just a multiplication of two of them — one along each axis.

You can see this result visualized in the bottom right. There's a sharp peak in the center — that’s the low-frequency content — and then it decays with oscillations outward, characteristic of sinc behavior.

Now here’s something more interesting: when we move into higher dimensions, something new becomes possible — rotation. In 1D, you can only flip a signal left or right, but there's no true concept of rotation. However, in 2D or 3D, you can rotate the object, and that rotation affects the frequency domain in a meaningful way.
This rotational property is one of the key advantages of analyzing signals in higher dimensions. It allows us to understand and manipulate how orientation in space translates into patterns in frequency.

39,"Let’s talk about something elegant and powerful — the rotation property of the Fourier transform.

Here’s the idea: if you rotate a two-dimensional function in space, then its Fourier transform also rotates — by the exact same angle and in the same direction. That means the structure of the frequency content preserves the orientation of the original signal.

For instance, if you rotate an image by 30 degrees counterclockwise, the entire frequency spectrum also rotates by 30 degrees counterclockwise. The shape and the distribution of frequencies remain the same, just oriented differently. This behavior is not just limited to 2D — it holds in any number of dimensions.

Why does this happen? Well, it comes from the mathematics of how the Fourier transform is defined. If we apply a rotation matrix — let’s call it R theta — to the spatial variable, we see that the frequency variable ends up rotated in exactly the same way. It’s a symmetry property built into the transform itself.

Now, the proof is shown here, and you’re welcome to follow through it if you like. It involves a change of variables and some linear algebra, but the takeaway is beautifully simple: rotate the function, and its spectrum rotates too.
This rotational invariance is one of the reasons Fourier analysis is so useful in imaging, especially in applications like object detection, texture analysis, and pattern recognition — where orientation should not change the essential features.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

40,"Let me now give you a more intuitive, geometric explanation for the rotation property of the Fourier transform.
Suppose you have a 2D function — like the white rectangular bar you see on the top-left image. This function has a certain frequency structure, and that’s captured in its Fourier transform, shown to the right.

Now, here’s the key idea: each point in the Fourier spectrum corresponds to a sinusoidal wave component — a wave moving in a specific direction and with a certain frequency. When you sum up all these wave components, you reconstruct the original image.

So what happens when we rotate the original function? Say we rotate it 45 degrees counterclockwise. Well, to reconstruct this rotated function using the same wave-based approach, each of those original wave components must also rotate by the same 45 degrees. That’s the only way they’ll still combine to match the rotated shape.

As you can see in the second row, the rotated spatial function leads to a rotated frequency spectrum. Both are rotated by the same angle, preserving the overall structure. This is what we mean by the rotation property of the Fourier transform.
You can verify this rigorously with mathematics, but this geometric reasoning gives us an intuitive, visual understanding of what’s happening.

This is part of a much deeper concept: the duality of information. You can think of an image as made of individual points — pixels or voxels — or as made of sinusoids, each with different directions and frequencies. These two views are completely interchangeable, and Fourier analysis is the bridge between them.

That’s why this topic is so foundational. It’s not just about imaging. Fourier analysis underlies many areas — in physics, engineering, and even mathematics — wherever we want to understand structure in terms of frequency.

On the left, we see the Greek letter delta. That symbolizes the delta function, which represents the particle-like, pointwise nature of signals — sharp, localized, discrete. It's our way of representing structure in the spatial or time domain.

Next to it is e to the power i-theta, a complex exponential. This captures the wave nature — smooth, oscillating, continuous. It represents sinusoids, and it's central to how we describe frequency, phase, rotation, and oscilation in the complex plane, describing wave propagation.

So together, delta and e to the i-theta — one representing particles, the other waves — form a kind of duality. And this duality runs throughout everything we’ve covered: convolution, linear systems, Fourier series, and Fourier transforms.
The real power of Fourier analysis is in how it unifies these two views. A signal can be described by where things happen — using delta functions — or by how things oscillate — using sinusoids. This interplay is what makes the field so rich and so widely applicable.

Inside the circle, you’ll see the expression: delta multiplied by e to the power i theta.That’s delta times e to the i theta.
This might remind you of Euler’s formula, where e to the power i theta equals cosine theta plus i times sine theta.
So this single term includes both a real part — the cosine — and an imaginary part — the sine.
Now, the delta function here stands for an impulse — something that happens instantly, at a single point in time.
Together, the delta and the exponential show us two building blocks we’ll come back to again and again: sharp spikes and smooth waves.
But that’s not enough to build real-world signals.

To represent a general signal, we also need to be able to shift and scale these building blocks.
Shifting means moving a function left or right in time.Scaling means stretching or compressing it, or changing its amplitude.
For example, with sine waves, we can change the frequency — making them faster or slower.We can also shift them in time — or scale the height — to make them louder or softer.

So when we say “operators need to shift and scale,” we mean we need to move and adjust these basic functions — the delta and the sine wave — to create more complex signals.
And with that power, we can build up any continuous or piecewise continuous function.

4,"Now let’s talk more specifically about how a function can be represented using the Fourier series or the Fourier transform.

At the top, we see a Fourier series representation. It tells us that a function of t — written as f of t — can be expressed as a sum over many terms.
Mathematically, this is written as:
f of t equals the sum from n equals negative infinity to positive infinity, of c  n times e to the power 2 pi i n t over capital T.
Each term in the sum is a complex exponential — and each coefficient, c  n, tells us how much of that particular frequency component is present in the signal.

Now how do we calculate these coefficients?
We use the formula:
c  n equals 1 over capital T, times the integral from 0 to capital T, of f of t multiplied by e to the power negative 2 pi i n t over capital T, d t.
So what we’re doing here is projecting the function f of t onto a basis function — that basis is the complex exponential. This is very much like taking an inner product between vectors.

You can think of the function as living in a high-dimensional space — in fact, infinitely many dimensions. Each basis function spans one of those directions. So when we compute c  n, we’re measuring how much f of t points in the direction of that basis function.
Now, what if the function isn’t periodic, or the period becomes very large?
That’s where the Fourier transform comes in.

Instead of summing over discrete frequencies, we move to a continuous frequency variable, often called s.
The Fourier transform of f of t is written as f hat of s, and it’s defined as:
The integral from negative infinity to positive infinity, of f of t times e to the power negative 2 pi i s t, d t.
To recover the original function, we use the inverse Fourier transform, which is:
f of t equals the integral from negative infinity to positive infinity, of f hat of s times e to the power 2 pi i s t, d s.

So you can see — when we move from a periodic function with period capital T, to a general function as T approaches infinity, the Fourier series becomes the Fourier transform.
This is a very elegant transition — from a discrete sum to a continuous integral — and it forms the basis of much of signal processing.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

5,"Now that we’ve covered the basics of the Fourier series and transform, let’s talk about a very important result: the Convolution Theorem.
This theorem creates a beautiful bridge between two worlds — the time domain and the frequency domain.

Here’s what it says:Convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain.
In simple terms, if you have a linear, time-invariant system, the output is the convolution of the input signal with the system’s impulse response.But instead of computing that convolution directly — which can be messy — you can switch to the frequency domain, where it becomes much easier.

So, let’s say:
f of t is your input signal,
g of t is the system’s impulse response,
and f star g means the convolution of f and g.
Then, in the frequency domain, their Fourier transforms — call them F of s and G of s — satisfy this simple rule:
The Fourier transform of the convolution equals the product of the individual Fourier transforms.

Or in math:Fourier of f star g equals F of s times G of s.
That means you now have two ways to compute the system’s output:
You can do convolution in the time domain.
Or — you can transform both the input and the impulse response into the frequency domain, multiply them there, and then take the inverse Fourier transform to go back to the time domain.
Now, let’s look at a simple example.

Suppose you convolve two rectangular functions, also called gate functions. Each one looks like a block or a box.
To compute the convolution, you flip one function, shift it, multiply the overlapping parts, and add the result.
When the two rectangles perfectly overlap, the area under the curve reaches its maximum. As they move apart, the overlapping area decreases linearly — and what you get is a triangle-shaped function.
So, two rectangles convolved give you a triangle.

Now let’s look at this in the frequency domain.
We know the Fourier transform of a rectangular function is a sinc function — that’s sinc of s, which comes from sine of pi s over pi s.
So when we convolve two rectangles in the time domain, we get a triangle. That means, in the frequency domain, we multiply two sinc functions — and we get sinc squared.
So: Triangle in time domain means sinc squared in frequency domain.

This is a powerful example that helps you visualize the convolution theorem in action. It shows how the shapes in time relate to the shapes in frequency — and why this theorem is such a key tool for signal processing and systems analysis.

6,"Now, let’s step back for a moment and ask a deeper question: Why does the convolution theorem work the way it does? What makes it so special?

In the last lecture, I mentioned something that gives us a clue.If you have a shift-invariant linear system, and you input a sinusoidal signal, what comes out is also a sinusoid, and — importantly — at the same frequency.
That’s a big deal.
It means the system doesn't generate any new frequencies. It doesn’t distort the sinusoid into some other shape. It simply scales it or shifts its phase — but the frequency stays the same.
This is a unique and powerful property of sinusoids.

Now let’s think about what that means for convolution and Fourier analysis.
In time-domain analysis, convolution is the operation that describes how a system responds to an input.
But if your input and your system are both described using sinusoids, and those sinusoids don’t change frequency, then it turns out convolution becomes multiplication in the Fourier domain.

Why?
Because in the Fourier domain, every signal is broken into sinusoids. And if each one stays intact — same frequency in, same frequency out — then multiplying their responses is all you need to compute the system output.
That’s exactly what the convolution theorem says:Convolution in time equals multiplication in frequency.
But — and this is important — this beautiful relationship only works because of the special behavior of sinusoids.
If your input signal isn’t made of sinusoids, or your system doesn’t treat them nicely, this property breaks down.
That’s why this theorem only exists for the Fourier transform, which is based entirely on sinusoids.Other transforms — like wavelets or polynomials — don’t have this same ""in equals out"" behavior, and so they don’t give us a convolution theorem in the same way.

If you’re curious, I actually encourage you to think about this more. You could even write a short paper or a reflection on it.
Here’s something to try:
Try proving that if a function goes into a system and the same form comes out — unchanged except for amplitude and phase — then that function must be a sinusoid.

And also prove the related idea:If sinusoids go in and come out with the same frequency, then convolution in time must match multiplication in frequency.
These are two different ideas — but together, they give us the foundation for the convolution theorem and explain why Fourier analysis is so powerful for linear systems.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

1. ..."
7,"Let’s now walk through an example to help us better understand why the convolution theorem works — especially when sinusoids are involved.

We’ll use a one-dimensional, shift-invariant linear system.In such a system, the output — which we’ll call o of t — is the convolution of the system’s impulse response h of t with the input signal, i of t.
So we write:
o of t equals h of t convolved with i of t.
According to the convolution theorem, when we take the Fourier transform of both sides, this convolution becomes multiplication.
So we have:
capital O of u equals capital H of u times capital I of u,where capital O, H, and I are the Fourier transforms of the output, impulse response, and input, respectively, and u is the frequency variable.

Now, let’s suppose we feed the system a complex sinusoidal input.That is:i of t equals e to the power i 2 pi u naught t,where u naught is the frequency of the sinusoid.
As we learned earlier, the Fourier transform of a pure sinusoidal signal is a delta function.So, in the frequency domain:
capital I of u equals delta of u minus u naught.
This delta function tells us the signal contains only one frequency — u naught — and no others.

Now, using the convolution theorem:
capital O of u equals capital H of u times delta of u minus u naught.
Multiplying anything by a delta function simply picks out the value at that point.So this simplifies to:
capital O of u equals H of u naught times delta of u minus u naught.
This tells us that the output, in the frequency domain, also consists of a single frequency — the same one as the input — and it’s just scaled by the system’s transfer function at that frequency, which is H of u naught.
Now we go back to the time domain.

If the Fourier transform of the output is a scaled delta function in frequency, then the time-domain output must also be a sinusoid — at the same frequency.
So, we have:
o of t equals H of u naught times e to the power i 2 pi u naught t.
This shows that the output is still a complex sinusoid — same frequency as the input — but scaled by a factor, H of u naught, which may include amplitude and phase changes.
The key idea here is:
The frequency doesn't change.
No new frequencies are generated.
The output stays sinusoidal if the input was sinusoidal.

This confirms that a shift-invariant linear system preserves frequency when the input is a pure sinusoid.
And we were able to demonstrate this clearly and quickly — thanks to the convolution theorem and the properties of the Fourier transform.
It’s a great example of how math gives us not just a result, but deep insight into how signals behave in systems.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
8,"Let me now show you the other direction of this idea — and this time, we’re not going to rely on the convolution theorem directly.

We’ll start with a simple question:Can any function other than a sinusoid go into a system and come out unchanged in shape — just scaled by a constant?
Let’s think about that.

Suppose the impulse response of the system is a delta function. Then, any signal you put into that system just passes through exactly as it is — unchanged. The system does nothing.This is an ideal system — it responds instantly and perfectly.

For example, if a camera had a perfect delta-function impulse response, every point in the scene would be captured exactly — with perfect sharpness, no blur at all.
But in real life, that doesn’t happen. No camera has a true delta response.

In practical systems, the impulse response is not a delta function — it’s more spread out. That means the system blurs things.Even if you feed it a sharp impulse, the output will be a wider, smeared version — not the same as the input.
So what does that mean in the frequency domain?

Well, we know that the Fourier transform of a delta function is a constant — it's just one everywhere.That’s because a delta contains all frequencies equally.
But if your impulse response is not a delta — if it’s more spread out — then its Fourier transform won’t be constant.It will vary in frequency. That’s key.

Now, let’s suppose you have some input signal — let’s call it i of t — and this signal goes into the system.You get an output o of t, and let’s say the output has the exact same shape as the input, just scaled by some number alpha.

That is:
o of t equals alpha times i of t.
That sounds simple, but let’s look at what it means in the frequency domain.
If we take the Fourier transform of both sides, we get:
Capital O of u equals alpha times capital I of u.
But from the convolution theorem, we also know:
Capital O of u equals capital H of u times capital I of u.
If we compare those two expressions, we find:
Capital H of u must equal alpha — a constant.
But as we just said, that would only be possible if h of t — the impulse response — is a delta function.And we assumed it's not.
So we have a contradiction.

That tells us:No function other than a sinusoid can go through a general shift-invariant linear system and come out with the same shape — unless the system is trivial, like an ideal delta.
Only sinusoids have this amazing property:Sinusoid in, sinusoid out — same frequency, just scaled and shifted in phase.
That’s what makes them so special in Fourier analysis.That’s why convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain — because the system affects each sinusoidal component independently and proportionally.

So what you see here is not just a bunch of equations — it’s a deeper logic behind the theorem.Understanding this helps you move beyond just memorizing formulas — it helps you truly see why Fourier analysis works the way it does.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

9,"Let’s now turn to a beautiful result in Fourier analysis called Parseval’s Identity.
This identity tells us that the total energy of a signal — measured in the time domain — is exactly equal to the total energy in the frequency domain.

Mathematically, it says:
The integral of the absolute value squared of f of t, over all time, equals the integral of the absolute value squared of f hat of s, over all frequencies.

In simpler words:If you take a signal and square its amplitude at each point in time, then add up all those values — you get the total energy of the signal in the time domain.
Now do the same thing in the frequency domain:Take the Fourier transform of the signal, square the magnitude of each frequency component, and integrate — and you get the same total.

This is not just a coincidence. It’s a direct consequence of the fact that the Fourier transform is a unitary operator — it preserves the “length” of the function, just like a rotation in vector space.
Think of f of t and f hat of s as infinite-dimensional vectors.Then, this identity is telling you that their norms — or their lengths — are the same.So, the energy stays the same when you move from one domain to the other.
This is why we sometimes say that the Fourier transform conserves energy.

The bottom part of the slide walks through the proof. Let me summarize the key steps:
We start with the inner product:
Integral of f of t times the complex conjugate of g of t.
Then, we apply the inverse Fourier transform to g of t.This gives us an expression involving f of t and the Fourier transform of g, which we call F g of s.
Then we do some algebra — using properties of complex conjugation, and switching the order of integration — until we end up with:
The integral of f of s times the complex conjugate of g of s.
So in the end, the inner product in the time domain equals the inner product in the frequency domain.

That’s Parseval’s Identity in action — and it works for all functions in an inner product space, not just in signal processing.
It’s one more reason why the Fourier transform is not just a clever trick — it’s a deep and powerful tool grounded in geometry and physics.
If you’re interested, you can think of it this way:Every time you transform a signal into the frequency domain, you’re rotating it into a new basis — and the energy stays exactly the same.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
10,"Let’s now apply Parseval’s theorem to a practical example — the average power of a periodic signal.

Here we’re working with a power signal, which is a signal that keeps oscillating over time, like a sine wave.
The average power P of such a signal over one period — from minus capital T over 2 to plus capital T over 2 — is given by:
P equals 1 over T, times the integral of the absolute value of x of t squared, d t.
According to Parseval’s theorem for power signals, we can also express this using the Fourier series coefficients.So, power equals the sum of the absolute value squared of all c  n — the Fourier coefficients — from n equals minus infinity to infinity.

Let’s go through the example.
Suppose we have this signal:
x of t equals 2 times sine of 100 t.
That’s just a sinusoidal wave with amplitude 2 and frequency 100.
Now, suppose this signal is the voltage across a unit resistor — that is, a resistor with resistance equal to 1 ohm.
Then the instantaneous power is just the voltage squared, and the average power is the integral of the squared signal over one period, divided by T.

Let’s calculate it first in the time domain:
We square the signal:2 times sine of 100 t becomes 4 times sine squared of 100 t.
When we compute the average of that over one period, we get:
P equals 2.

Now let’s do it in the frequency domain, using the Fourier series.
We rewrite the sine wave using Euler’s formula:
sine of 100 t equals e to the j 100 t minus e to the minus j 100 t, over 2 j.
So our signal becomes:
x of t equals 2 times that expression, which simplifies to:
minus j e to the j 100 t, plus j e to the minus j 100 t.
Comparing this to the general form of a Fourier series:
x of t equals the sum of c  n times e to the j n omega naught t,we can identify the coefficients:
c  1 equals minus j, andc  minus 1 equals plus j.

Now we apply Parseval’s theorem:
The total power is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients.
So we compute:
absolute value of c one squared, which is 1,plus absolute value of c minus one squared, also 1.
Adding them gives us 2 — the same result we got in the time domain.

This example shows how Parseval’s theorem works in practice.
You can either:
Square the signal and average it over time,or Decompose the signal into its sinusoidal components, square their coefficients, and sum them up.

Either way, you’ll get the same result. That’s the beauty of Fourier analysis — it gives you two consistent views of the same signal.
And this works not just for simple sine waves — it holds even when a signal is made up of many frequencies, including very high ones.Just square each coefficient, add them up, and you’ll know the total power of the signal.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

11,"Let’s take a moment to review this important concept — how a continuous function can be represented using delta functions.
You may remember that the delta function plays a central role in signal processing.
And here's the key idea:When you multiply a delta function with a continuous function f of t, and integrate over all time, the result is just the value of f at the point where the delta is centered.

Mathematically, we write:
The integral from minus infinity to infinity of delta of t minus t naught, times f of t, d t — equals f of t naught.
This tells us that the delta function samples the value of f at t naught.It picks out that one value and ignores everything else.

Now, you might wonder how this works — so here’s an intuitive explanation.
Think of the delta function as the limit of a very narrow and very tall pulse — getting narrower and taller, but always keeping the same area, which is 1.

So if we take that narrow pulse, center it at t naught, and multiply it with f of t, we get a tiny slice of the function near t naught.
When we integrate over that narrow region, the result becomes:
f of t star, where t star is some point very close to t naught.
And in the limit — as the width goes to zero — that becomes exactly:
f of t naught.
So this is how we record a sample.

It also leads us to a deeper interpretation:
We can reconstruct the entire function f of t by summing up all these infinitesimal slices — each one represented by a delta function, placed at the right location, and scaled by the value of the function at that point.

That’s what this second formula is saying:
f of t equals the integral from minus infinity to infinity of delta of tau minus t, times f of tau, d tau.
It’s a kind of weighted sum of deltas — where the weights are just the values of the function itself.

You can think of this as a very fine-grained, particle-like view of a continuous function.Each point — each “particle” — contributes through a delta function, and together, they rebuild the original signal.
This is not just a mathematical trick — it connects deeply with how we sample, record, and reconstruct signals in the real world.
And once again, it highlights why the delta function is so important — both in theory and in practice.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

12,"Let’s revisit the convolution theorem — this time with a concrete visual example to help reinforce the idea.
This theorem is incredibly important, and we’ll keep coming back to it.So it's essential to get comfortable with how it works — both mathematically and visually.

Let’s look at what we have here.
In the top row, we see three time-domain signals:
On the left is f of x, a simple rectangular function, also known as a gate function, centered at zero and extending from minus b over 2 to plus b over 2.
In the middle is h of x, which consists of two delta functions — located symmetrically around zero at minus a over 2 and plus a over 2.
On the right is the result of the convolution of f and h — which we’ll call g of x.

Now remember:When you convolve a function with a delta, the result is simply a shifted version of that function.
So here, convolving the gate function f of x with each of the two deltas in h of x gives us two shifted gate functions — one shifted left and one shifted right.
When we add them together, we get g of x — a pair of rectangular pulses.
Now let’s look at the bottom row — this is the frequency domain.
Here’s where the convolution theorem comes in.

According to the theorem:
Convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain.
So we take the Fourier transforms of the three signals:
f of x becomes capital F of k, which is a sinc-shaped curve — smooth and localized in frequency.
h of x, which had two deltas in time, becomes a cosine wave in the frequency domain — that’s capital H of k, centered at zero, with oscillations depending on the spacing of the deltas.

Now, to get capital G of k, we multiply the two frequency-domain functions:
Capital F of k times capital H of k equals capital G of k.
And the result, shown on the right, is a modulated sinc — essentially the original sinc shape, but with oscillations introduced by the cosine multiplier.

So the key takeaway is this:
In time, the convolution added and shifted the pulses.
In frequency, the multiplication mixed the smooth sinc shape with oscillations.
This is a perfect visual illustration of what the convolution theorem does:
It transforms an operation that involves sliding and summing in time into a much simpler pointwise multiplication in the frequency domain.

13,"We’ve now come to a natural turning point in our discussion.
So far, everything we’ve studied — from Fourier series and Fourier transforms, to convolution and delta functions — has been in the continuous domain.

But now we need to ask a very important question:Why do we work with digital signals? Why go digital?

Well, here are some good reasons.
First — digital signals are exact.They’re stored as numbers, so they don’t degrade over time the way analog signals do.

Second — errors can be detected and corrected.Digital systems can automatically check for mistakes during transmission or storage — and even fix them.

Third — noise and interference can be filtered out more easily.In a digital system, it's much simpler to distinguish real data from unwanted signals.

Fourth — with digital transmission, we can send multiple types of information over the same line — audio, video, text — all bundled together efficiently.

And finally — digital systems support data compression, which lets us send more information using less bandwidth.

All of this is why most modern communication, computation, and imaging systems have moved to the digital domain.
And that brings us to the next part of our journey.
Let’s study how to process digital signals next.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
14,"Now that we’ve seen why digital signals are so useful, let’s take a look at how real-world signals actually make their way into a computer.
This diagram shows the full journey — from a physical system to digital data inside your laptop.

Let’s walk through it step by step.
It all starts with the physical world — maybe we’re measuring temperature, pressure, light intensity, motion, or some other physical quantity.

To capture this, we need a sensor — or more specifically, a transducer.A transducer converts the physical phenomenon into an electrical signal — usually an analog one.This analog signal may be noisy, or it may contain extra fluctuations we don’t want.

So the next step is called signal conditioning.Here we might filter the signal, smooth it, amplify it, or perform other adjustments to get it into a clean, usable form.This step helps us reduce noise and make sure the signal is suitable for the next stage.

Now comes the critical component — the Analog-to-Digital Converter, or A-D converter for short.
This is where the continuous analog signal gets sampled and turned into a digital signal — a sequence of numbers the computer can store and process.

More specifically, to get a analog signal into the computer, let’s break down what happens during digitization with an A/D converter — using this visual example.

Here you see an analog signal, represented here as a smooth, continuous wave — like a sound wave moving across time.Actually, a digital computer can’t store this continuous curve directly.Instead, it must sample the signal at specific time points.

At each of these time points, we ask:What is the value of the signal right here?And that gives us a sequence of numbers.
In the rightmost illustration, you can see vertical bars that “catch” the wave at regular intervals.These bars represent sampling operations — and the height of each bar shows the value of the signal at that point in time.

Now, here's something important:The computer can’t store every possible value — like pi=3.14159 etc. or e=2.71828 etc. with infinite precision.Instead, it must round the values to the nearest available level.
This process is called quantization.It means converting a smooth, continuous range of amplitudes into a set of fixed, discrete values — often represented by whole numbers.

So here, we get a string of numbers like:3, 5, 6, 6, 4, 2, 1, 2.
And these numbers are what the computer stores.
But even these whole numbers aren’t stored in decimal form.Computers use binary — just zeros and ones to represent either an integral or a decimal number.

So each number gets translated into binary. For example:
1 becomes zero one,
2 becomes one zero,
3 becomes one one,
and so on.
This is how a continuous analog signal — like sound or temperature — becomes a digital signal inside a computer:First through sampling across time, then through quantization of amplitude, and finally through binary encoding.

Each step introduces a tradeoff:
More sampling points give better resolution in time.
More quantization levels give better precision in amplitude.
But more of both means more data to store and process.
This is the foundation of digital signal processing — and now you’ve seen how it all begins.

And finally, that digital data — made up of zeros and ones — enters the computer, where it can be displayed, analyzed, stored, or transmitted.

So again, the pipeline goes like this:
Physical system → transducer → signal conditioning → analog-to-digital conversion → computer.
This entire process happens in almost every modern system — from medical devices to smart homes to autonomous vehicles.
And the better we understand this chain, the better we can design systems that are accurate, efficient, and reliable.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:

15,"So now that we’ve brought our signal into the computer, let’s take a closer look at what’s really happening during analog-to-digital conversion.

As you can see in the top plot, we start with a smooth, continuous signal — x of t — defined for all time and with continuous amplitude.
But the computer can’t store that continuous curve — it needs discrete data.
So we begin with the first major step: sampling, also called discretization in time.
This means we only record the value of the signal at selected time points — evenly spaced along the horizontal axis.At each of these points, we “catch” the value of the signal, just like placing a pin at that instant.
‘
Now, the second step is quantization — converting the amplitude of each sample into a finite-precision value.
We can’t store irrational numbers like pi or e with infinite precision.Instead, we round them to a reasonable approximation — say, 3.14 for pi.And for our purposes, we assume this rounding is accurate enough to not affect the result significantly.
So in our analysis, we mostly ignore the quantization error and focus on sampling — the time discretization.

The bottom diagram shows how the sampled signal looks:It’s now a series of impulses — each one located at a sample time and scaled to the value of the original signal at that moment.
This sequence of impulses is what we work with in digital signal processing.

But here’s something important to remember:
The real signal — the one that matters in the physical world — is still continuous.
What we do with computers is a second-best approximation, based on discrete samples.

So the key question becomes:
Can we process these sampled values in a way that still lets us understand or recover the original continuous signal?
This is the challenge at the heart of signal processing — bridging the gap between discrete computation and continuous reality.

16,"Now, let’s go back and revisit the question we just posed:If we take a continuous signal and convert it into discrete samples, can we still reconstruct the original signal?
To explore that, let’s start with this example — a pure continuous wave.

Here, we’ve plotted the function5 times sine of 2 pi 4 tThat’s a simple sine wave with amplitude 5 and frequency 4 cycles per second — or 4 hertz.
And this signal is completely continuous in both time and amplitude.
That means it's defined for every instant in time, not just selected points, and the values can take on any number, not just a limited set.
This is the kind of signal you might get from an ideal microphone or sensor measuring vibration, sound, or light — in the real world, before any digital conversion takes place.

But here’s the key point:
The computer can’t store this curve as it is.So we need to figure out: How often do we need to sample this signal to capture all the important information?
How dense should our sampling be, so that we don’t lose critical features?
And that question brings us right to the Sampling Theorem — the mathematical foundation for how we digitize continuous signals without losing information.
That’s exactly what we’ll examine next.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
17,"So here we have another view of that same example.
This wave has a frequency of 4 hertz — meaning it completes 4 full cycles per second.

Now we’re sampling it with a very small interval, or in other words, at a very high rate: 256 samples per second. That’s far more frequent than the wave itself changes.
And the result is what we call well-sampled data.

As you can see, the discrete dots — the sampling points — follow the shape of the original wave very closely.There’s no confusion. No ambiguity. No major information is lost.
This is exactly what we want when digitizing a signal — the samples capture the behavior of the original continuous signal with high accuracy.

Heuristically, you can just look at the plot and say: yes, these samples preserve the essence of the original wave.
So, in this case, we can confidently say: the sampling was successful.
But what if we sample too slowly?
Let’s take a look at that next.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:

18,"Now here’s what happens when the sampling is too slow.
This plot shows a rapidly oscillating signal — it's a sine wave with a high frequency. But look at those red dots. Those are the actual points we sampled, and as you can see, there are only a few of them.
This is a classic case of under-sampling.

In this case, the original signal — that fine blue waveform — is oscillating at a frequency of 8 hertz. But the sampling rate is just 8.5 samples per second, which is not high enough to capture the details of the wave.

So what’s the problem?
Well, based on just the red dots, it might look like the wave is slowly rising and falling — as if it’s a low-frequency signal. But that’s not true at all.
This is known as aliasing — when a high-frequency signal gets misinterpreted as something much lower in frequency, simply because it was sampled too slowly.
So even though you're doing regular sampling — evenly spaced in time — the result can be very misleading if your sampling rate is too low.

This example shows why choosing the right sampling rate is critical.Too slow, and you could end up completely misrepresenting your signal.

On the left, we have a smooth, continuous function — like something you might see in the physical world, such as a sound wave or a voltage signal. It's defined at every instant in time.

But to work with this signal on a computer, we can't use all those infinite points. Instead, we select only a finite number of values, spaced out at regular intervals. That's what's shown on the right.
This process is called sampling.

If we sample densely enough — meaning, if the points are close together — then the discrete version can represent the continuous signal fairly accurately. The more samples we take, the more detail we preserve from the original waveform.

So the idea is: start with a smooth, continuous signal and convert it into a sequence of numbers that still captures the shape and behavior of the original. That's what makes signal processing on computers possible.

In the middle, you see the result of sparse sampling. We’re only picking up a few values. And when we try to reconstruct the signal, shown on the right, we get something much smoother and simpler than the original. It might even look okay at first glance, but it’s actually wrong.

All that detail — all the fast oscillations — is lost. Even worse, the reconstructed version can look like a completely different signal, with a false shape or even the wrong frequency.
This is what we call aliasing. It happens when the sampling rate is too low to capture the higher-frequency components. And once they’re lost, you can’t recover them from the sampled data.

21,"Let’s now look at what’s happening in the spatial domain when we sample a signal.

Imagine you have a continuous signal — shown on the left. To sample this signal, what we’re really doing is multiplying it by a train of impulses. That’s the middle figure.
These impulses are spaced evenly along the axis, representing fixed sampling intervals. And when you multiply the continuous signal by this impulse train, the result is a set of discrete values. That’s what you see on the right: only the values of the signal at those impulse positions are preserved — the rest are discarded.

In the spatial domain, sampling is essentially a point-wise multiplication of the signal with an impulse train.
And here’s the key idea: this operation in the spatial domain has a direct consequence in the frequency domain. Multiplying by an impulse train in space corresponds to replicating the spectrum of the signal — creating a periodic train of delta functions in the frequency domain.
Just as we observe periodicity in time or space due to regular sampling, we also obtain periodicity in frequency. This connection — between operations in the spatial domain and their effects in the frequency domain — is fundamental in signal processing.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

22,"Now let’s move to the frequency domain and see what sampling looks like there.
Earlier, we saw that sampling in the spatial or time domain means multiplying the signal by an impulse train. In the frequency domain, that multiplication becomes a convolution.

Here’s what happens:
On the left, we have the original signal’s spectrum — a smooth curve that shows how the energy is spread across different frequencies.
In the center, we see a train of delta functions. These represent the periodic sampling pattern in the time domain.
When we convolve the original spectrum with this delta train, what we get is shown on the right: multiple shifted copies of the original spectrum. One in the center, and others repeated at regular intervals to the left and right. These are called spectral replicas.

Now, this setup is fine if the copies don’t overlap. But in the case shown here, the original spectrum is wide — it spreads across many frequencies — and the spacing between these delta peaks is not large enough. So the replicas overlap, and this overlap is what causes aliasing.

Aliasing is when different frequency components get mixed together. It’s like solving the equation x plus y equals 10,  you can't tell how much is x and how much is y. Similarly, when spectra overlap, you lose the ability to tell which part of the signal came from which frequency. That’s a problem.

So to avoid aliasing, we need to space those spectral copies far enough apart — which means we need a high enough sampling rate in the time domain. That ensures each frequency copy stays separate, and the original signal can be recovered accurately.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

23,"Now let’s shift gears and talk about conditioning in the spatial domain.

Suppose you start with a signal that has a lot of sharp changes — a noisy or high-frequency function, like the one shown on the left. Before sampling or further processing, we often want to smooth out the extremes. This helps avoid issues like aliasing or instability in reconstruction.

So what do we do?
We multiply the signal by a smooth, bell-shaped function — something like a Gaussian. That’s the curve shown in the middle. This operation acts like a soft window. It suppresses the values at the edges and emphasizes the center part of the signal.
The result, shown on the right, is a conditioned signal. It’s still based on the original data, but now it’s more concentrated, more stable, and less prone to causing problems downstream.

This process is called conditioning — and in the spatial domain, it’s done by pointwise multiplication. We’re not changing the signal globally — just shaping it locally to make it behave better.
This idea becomes even more powerful when we look at its effect in the frequency domain — and that’s where we’re headed next.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:

24,"Now let’s see why we’re often better off working in the frequency domain.
Suppose we start with a nicely concentrated spectrum — something like the narrow peak shown on the left. This means our signal in the spatial domain is smooth and well-behaved.

Now, when we sample the signal — which, in the frequency domain, corresponds to a convolution with a delta train — we generate copies of this spectrum. These appear periodically across the frequency axis. You can see a central copy and two others on either side.
If the original spectrum is narrow enough, these copies won’t overlap — and that’s a key idea. No overlap means no aliasing. That’s good news.

In this case, we can use a low-pass filter to isolate the central copy and discard the rest. This makes it possible to perfectly reconstruct the original signal from its samples.

That’s why frequency domain analysis is so powerful — it gives us a clear way to understand, diagnose, and even fix sampling-related problems. And it’s where the idea of an ideal sampling filter comes in. This filter selects only what we need and suppresses what we don’t.
We’ll explore this concept even further as we continue.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
25,"So what does an ideal sampling filter look like?

Let’s start in the frequency domain. If we want to keep only the part of the spectrum we care about, we can apply a rectangular window — often called a gate function. This simply means we multiply the spectrum by a box that passes certain frequencies and zeros out the rest. Everything outside the band is eliminated.

Now here’s the important part: multiplication in the frequency domain corresponds to convolution in the spatial or time domain. So when we apply this gate in Fourier space, the corresponding operation in the spatial domain is convolution with the inverse Fourier transform of the rectangle. And that inverse transform is something we’ve seen before — it’s the sinc function.

This sinc function has a sharp central peak and extends out forever with oscillating ripples. We say it has infinite support, and those ripples are often called ringing. So while the ideal filter works perfectly in theory, it’s not so practical in real applications. Why? Because we can’t build something with infinite extent. But conceptually, it’s extremely valuable — it helps us understand the limits of what’s possible in signal reconstruction.

We’ll next look at what happens when we approximate this ideal.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:

26,"Now let’s talk about a more practical — but less perfect — alternative: the cheap sampling filter.

Suppose we switch things around. Instead of applying a gate function in the frequency domain, we use a sinc function there. In that case, its counterpart in the time domain is a rectangular function.

This rectangle acts like a local averaging window — it smooths the signal by averaging values over a small time interval. You can think of it as performing a moving average across discrete sample points to approximate the original continuous signal.

It’s a simple, easy-to-implement method — and that’s why we call it ""cheap."" But here's the tradeoff: it’s far from ideal.
In the frequency domain, we’re no longer cleanly cutting off frequencies beyond a certain band. The sinc function doesn’t have sharp boundaries, so it doesn’t isolate frequencies as cleanly as the gate function would. That means the resulting reconstruction may lose some fidelity or allow unwanted frequency components to leak in.

So yes — this filter is convenient and fast, but it comes at the cost of precision.
Next, we’ll explore how filtering in the spatial domain can help improve this.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

27,"When we want a practical alternative to the ideal or cheap sampling filters, a Gaussian filter offers a great compromise.

Now, what makes the Gaussian special is this: its Fourier transform is also a Gaussian. That’s quite rare — most functions change significantly when transformed between the spatial and frequency domains. But the Gaussian stays in the same form, just scaled differently.
So, if you multiply by a Gaussian in the frequency domain, that corresponds to convolving with a Gaussian in the spatial or time domain — and vice versa.

Why is this helpful? Because the Gaussian function decays very quickly. That means we avoid the problem of infinite ringing, like we saw with the sinc function. Instead of having a sharp cutoff, which can cause artifacts, the Gaussian gives a smooth transition and localized effect — both in frequency and in space.

It's not mathematically perfect, but it’s practical. And in many real-world applications — especially in imaging and signal processing — that’s the trade-off we need.
So overall, the Gaussian sampling filter is a good, balanced choice that works well in both domains.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

28,"Alright, let’s take a step further and make things more precise.

Earlier, I showed you some cartoon-like pictures to build intuition. Now, let’s look at the actual math behind those ideas — starting with the delta function.

In signal processing, the delta function plays a key role — especially when we have a series of delta functions lined up at regular intervals. We often call this a comb, because visually, it looks just like the teeth of a hair comb.
Here’s the key idea.

Imagine you have a bunch of delta functions spaced by a fixed time interval, T. We write that as:s of t equals the sum of delta of t minus n times T.
Now, when you take the Fourier transform of this comb-shaped signal, something beautiful happens. You get another comb — but this time in the frequency domain.

There’s a simple rule:
If the spacing in time is T,
Then the spacing in frequency becomes 1 over T.
The impulses are still evenly spaced, but now they live in the frequency domain. And their height is scaled by a factor of 1 over T.
So this transformation turns one comb into another — just flipped into frequency space, with inverted spacing.
This is a fundamental result you’ll see in many signal processing books. Different authors may use different symbols — like f or u for frequency, or j or i in the exponential — but the meaning is the same.

Also, keep in mind that delta functions are really convenient in Fourier analysis. When you plug a delta function into the Fourier formula, it simplifies easily — because a delta picks out a single point.
And when you shift the delta in time — say, to delta of t minus some value — the result in frequency becomes a complex exponential, like e to the j 2 pi f zero t. That’s thanks to the shift theorem.

So, the takeaway here is:a comb of delta functions in time becomes another comb in frequency — just with spacing flipped and amplitude scaled.
This sets the stage for understanding how sampling works in both domains. We’ll build on this in the slides that follow.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
29,"Let’s now take a closer look at the Fourier transform of this impulse train — and I’ll explain it in a way that’s easier to follow, even if not perfectly rigorous.

Suppose we have a signal made of delta functions spaced by a fixed interval, capital T. This is a periodic function, right? It repeats every T. So we can use a Fourier series to represent it.

We write this function, s T of t, as a sum of delta functions at every multiple of T:s T of t equals the sum over n of delta of t minus n T.
Now, since it's periodic, we can also express it as a sum of complex exponentials — that’s what a Fourier series does. So we write:s T of t equals the sum over n of c n times e to the power j 2 pi n t over T,where c n is the Fourier coefficient.
To compute c n, we take the standard approach:c n equals 1 over T times the integral over one period of s T of t multiplied by e to the power negative j 2 pi n t over T.
But here’s the trick — remember that s T of t is a train of delta functions. That means when you integrate, only the delta at t = 0 survives. 

The result is simply:c n equals 1 over T.
So when you plug this back in, your entire Fourier series becomes a sum of complex exponentials, each with coefficient 1 over T.
Now, there’s a well-known identity:A sum of complex exponentials with equal spacing and equal weights becomes a train of delta functions in the frequency domain.

So finally, we can write:s T of t transforms to (1 over T) times s 1 over T of u.That is, the train of impulses in time maps to another train of impulses in frequency, with flipped spacing and scaled amplitude.
This is what we call a Fourier pair. A comb in one domain becomes another comb in the other domain — with the spacing inverted and amplitude scaled.
This idea is fundamental in signal processing. You’ll see it over and over — whether you’re analyzing sampling, modulation, or reconstruction.

Now, I’ll admit — this version of the derivation is not entirely rigorous. It's a bit hand-wavy. A more precise proof would involve deeper mathematical tools, especially when it comes to convergence. But for our purposes, this intuitive explanation gives you the right picture.

So just keep this in mind:A periodic sequence of impulses in time transforms into another periodic sequence in frequency, and the spacing and amplitude follow a simple reciprocal relationship.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:

30,"Let’s take a moment to revisit this important concept — the impulse train, or what we often call a ""comb"", and its mirror relationship in the Fourier domain.

On the left side, we see a train of delta functions spaced by a constant interval, capital T. This lives in the time domain. And on the right, we see another train of delta functions — this time in the frequency domain — spaced by one over T.

This is a classic Fourier pair. When you take the Fourier transform of a periodic train of impulses in time, you get another train of impulses in frequency. And the spacing in the frequency domain is the reciprocal of the spacing in the time domain.

Now, let’s look at the lower pair of plots.
Here, the red comb has impulses spaced by a small interval, delta t. In that case, the spacing in the frequency domain becomes capital P, which equals one over delta t.
Again, we see the same idea — spacing in one domain leads to reciprocal spacing in the other. This reciprocal relationship is a fundamental feature of the Fourier transform.
The height or amplitude also changes accordingly. Specifically, when the spacing decreases — say, from T to delta t — the impulses become more densely packed, and the total energy gets spread out more in frequency space. So the amplitudes must be adjusted accordingly to conserve energy.

So in summary:A periodic impulse train in time becomes a periodic impulse train in frequency.The spacing flips — T becomes 1 over T.The amplitudes are scaled appropriately.
This relationship is so central to sampling, reconstruction, and many other applications in signal processing. You’ll see it again and again — both in theory and in practice.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

31,"Now let’s dive into the process of sampling a signal — how we go from the continuous world to the digital one.

Look first at the top-left plot. That’s our original continuous signal, shown over a finite interval, from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2. Our goal is to digitize this — to convert it into a form that we can process on a computer.
And to do that, we take measurements at evenly spaced time intervals. This step is crucial, because without any prior knowledge about the signal, we don't know where we should sample more densely or more sparsely — so we just use uniform sampling.

We model this sampling process mathematically by multiplying the signal with a train of impulses — those red vertical lines spaced by delta t. This models a measurement being taken at regular intervals — just like a thermometer recording temperature every hour.

When we multiply the continuous function by this comb of impulses, we’re essentially pulling out values at those discrete points. The result is a sampled signal, where the values are available only at those locations. That’s what you see in the next plot below — the discrete signal.

Now shift your attention to the right-hand side — to the frequency domain.
The original continuous signal, when transformed using the Fourier transform, gives us a spectrum — and here it's shown to be concentrated between minus W and plus W. That’s the bandwidth of the signal — most of its energy lies within that frequency range.
And here’s something interesting: if a signal is limited in time — meaning it's non-zero only within a certain interval — then its Fourier transform will spread out infinitely. But if the time-domain signal is smooth, then the energy in its spectrum decays very fast. So in practice, we can often ignore the tiny tails and just focus on the dominant part within minus W to W.

Now, here comes the key insight.
When we sample the time-domain signal using a comb — a series of impulses spaced by delta t — then in the frequency domain, the Fourier transform becomes a convolution. That convolution replicates the original spectrum at regular intervals — and those intervals are one over delta t, which we denote as capital P.
So in the frequency domain, we now have multiple copies of the original spectrum, all spaced by P. These are sometimes called spectral replicas.

And here’s the big question: how small should delta t be? Or in other words — how dense should our sampling be — so that these spectral copies don’t overlap?
Because if they overlap, we get aliasing, and the original signal can’t be recovered. But if P — that is, one over delta t — is large enough, then these copies stay nicely separated, and we can isolate just one of them to recover the original signal perfectly.

So in short, if we sample densely enough, we don't lose any information. We can convert a continuous signal to a digital one and then reconstruct it — as if nothing was lost.
And that naturally brings us to the next topic — what is the minimum sampling rate we need to guarantee perfect recovery?
Let’s take a look.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

32,"Let’s go back to the real form of the Fourier series.

Here’s the idea: if you have a periodic function — let’s call it f of t — you can express it as a weighted sum of sines and cosines.

The formula goes like this:
f of t equalsa naught divided by 2,plus the sum, from n equals 1 to N,of a n times cosine of 2 pi n t,plus b n times sine of 2 pi n t.

In this expression, a naught is the average value of the function over one full period. That’s also called the DC component.
The rest of the terms — the cosine and sine parts — describe how the function varies over time. Each n corresponds to a different frequency: the higher the value of n, the higher the frequency.

Now, how do we compute those coefficients — a naught, a n, and b n?
Let’s start with a naught divided by 2.
That’s equal to the integral of f of t from 0 to 1.In other words, you’re just averaging the function over one period.
Next, to compute a n,you take 2 times the integral from 0 to 1of f of t times cosine of 2 pi n t.
And to compute b n,You take 2 times the integral from 0 to 1of f of t times sine of 2 pi n t.
Each coefficient tells you how much of that sine or cosine wave is present in the original function.

Now here's something important:The lowest frequency in this series appears when n equals 1. That corresponds to a frequency of 2 pi.The highest frequency depends on N, which is the upper limit of the sum — and that gives us a maximum frequency of 2 pi times N.
So by adjusting N, we can control how detailed our approximation is.
This is the real-valued Fourier series — a sum of sine and cosine waves, each scaled by how much of that frequency exists in your signal.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

33,"Now, let’s connect Fourier series with sampling.

Suppose you have a function, like the one shown here, and you want to represent it over time using a Fourier series. The key idea is this:
If your function is defined over a unit interval — let’s say from zero to one — then the standard real-form Fourier series can represent it as a sum of cosine and sine terms, just like we saw earlier.
That’s perfectly fine when your function repeats every one second. But in general, a real-world signal may repeat over a different period — maybe two seconds, or ten seconds, or any value we call capital P.

So, how do we handle that?
The answer is: you simply normalize your time axis. You scale the time so that the function fits into a unit interval. Then you apply the standard Fourier series there.
Once you’ve built the series, you can scale it back to its original time frame — from zero to capital P — and you get a Fourier expansion that models the function over its true period.

So to summarize: the Fourier series has the flexibility to represent any periodic function, no matter what its period is. You just need to adjust for that period in the formulation — and the structure stays exactly the same.
This makes Fourier analysis an incredibly powerful tool when dealing with signals of any repeating pattern.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

34,"Let’s now talk about estimating the DC component in a signal.

Suppose we have a continuous function, and we sample it over the interval from zero to one. The first question we should ask is: how can we estimate the DC term?

Remember, in a Fourier series, the DC component is the constant part of the signal — and mathematically, it’s given by the average value of the function over one full period. So, for a continuous function, that just means integrating from zero to one and dividing by the length of the interval.

Now, in practice, we don't work with continuous signals — we sample them. That means we take a finite number of measurements, evenly spaced across the interval. So how do we estimate the DC component from those samples?
Very simply: we add up all the sampled values, and then we take the average. That average gives us a good estimate of the DC component — the constant term in the Fourier series. 
So once we’ve taken care of the DC term, we still need to determine the coefficients for the sine and cosine terms — the oscillating parts of the signal.

Let’s say we want to recover N cosine coefficients and N sine coefficients. That gives us a total of 2 times N unknowns. And to solve for 2N unknowns, we’ll need at least 2N independent equations — meaning 2N sampled values.
So the takeaway is this: to fully recover a periodic signal using its Fourier series up to N harmonics, you need at least 2N equally spaced sample points. That gives you just enough information to solve for all the Fourier coefficients.
And again, the DC component is simple — just average your samples.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

35,"Now let’s explore an interesting point in signal representation — how sine and cosine terms can be combined.

In Fourier analysis, you’ll often see expressions involving both sine and cosine terms. For example, something like A sine theta plus B cosine theta. This is a common way to write periodic signals, using a mix of sines and cosines.
But here’s the neat part: this combination can actually be rewritten as a single sine function — with an amplitude and a phase shift. In other words, we can express it as R sine theta plus alpha, where R is the amplitude and alpha is the phase.

This identity is not just useful — it’s powerful. It tells us that instead of dealing with two separate unknowns, A and B, we can represent the same information using two different unknowns: R, the amplitude, and alpha, the phase.
So nothing is lost — we’re simply transforming the representation. Instead of working in the sine-cosine basis, we switch to amplitude and phase.

If you're curious about the proof or how this identity works, you can easily find tutorials or short videos online that walk through the steps in detail.
But the main takeaway here is: whenever you have a sine and cosine pair, you can always combine them into a single sine with a shifted angle. It’s a cleaner and often more intuitive way to represent oscillating signals — especially when we want to talk about signal magnitude and delay.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

36,"Let’s now take a heuristic view to better understand the relationship between sampling and signal reconstruction.
Suppose we represent our signal using a sum of sinusoids. Each term looks like this: A n sine of 2 pi nu t plus phi n. Here, A n is the amplitude, phi n is the phase, and nu is the frequency.

So for each sinusoidal component, we need to determine two unknowns — amplitude and phase. That means, for N such components, we end up with 2N unknowns in total.

Now, here’s the key point. To determine those two unknowns for each sinusoid — amplitude and phase — we need at least two data points per cycle. Think of it like trying to draw a sine wave: if you only know one point, you can’t say much. But with two points, you start to get the shape — its size and where it starts.

So, for the highest frequency in our signal — which we’ll call nu — we need to sample at least twice per cycle. This leads to the idea of spacing between samples. To avoid missing any important information, the spacing between adjacent samples must be less than or equal to 1 over 2 nu.

In more familiar terms, that means the sampling rate — measured in samples per second — must be greater than 2 times nu. This is the famous Nyquist sampling rate.

Why does this matter? Because if we sample below this rate, we risk losing information. Our signal might be distorted or misrepresented — a problem known as aliasing. But if we sample at twice the highest frequency or more, we guarantee that every sinusoidal component is accurately captured.
So the Nyquist rate gives us a fundamental guideline: sample fast enough to resolve the highest frequency present in the signal.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

37,"Now we’re entering the most important part of this discussion — the mathematical foundation behind the sampling theorem.

Let’s start by recalling our goal: we want to take a continuous signal, sample it at regular intervals, and then perfectly reconstruct the original signal from just those samples. But this only works under certain conditions — particularly, when the sampling rate is high enough to avoid aliasing. That’s what the Nyquist theorem guarantees.

Now, let’s walk through this derivation step by step. It’s a bit more mathematical, but I’ll explain the reasoning behind each part.

We begin by expressing the function f of t as the inverse Fourier transform of a product — specifically, a low-pass filter in the frequency domain multiplied by a sampled version of the original function’s spectrum. Symbolically, we write:
f of t equals the inverse Fourier transform of the product of capital Pi  P of u and the convolution of f hat of u with S P of u.

Next, we apply properties of the Fourier transform. We pull out the convolution and apply inverse transforms separately. This leads to:
f of t equals the inverse transform of Pi  P of u, convolved with the inverse transform of f hat of u multiplied by S  P of u.
Then, we take this result back to the time domain.

Here’s what we get:f of t equals P times sinc of pi P t, convolved with f of t times S 1 over P of t.
This expression means we’re convolving the sinc function — which comes from the inverse transform of a box function in frequency — with the sampled version of the original function.

And from there, we arrive at the reconstruction formula you’ve probably seen before:
f of t equals the sum over k from minus infinity to infinity of f at k over P times sinc of pi times the quantity t minus k over P over pi times the quantity t minus k over P.
This is the classic sinc interpolation formula. It tells us that, under the right sampling conditions — meaning, the sampling rate is at least twice the highest frequency in the signal — the continuous signal can be reconstructed exactly by convolving the samples with the sinc function.

So in summary: sampling in the time domain corresponds to periodic replication in the frequency domain. When the signal is bandlimited and the sampling rate is high enough, we can perfectly reconstruct it using this formula.
This is the core of the sampling theorem. And this formula — the final one on the slide — is one of the most beautiful results in signal processing.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

38,"Let’s go through a helpful example using a two-dimensional rectangular function. This is a classic case to build intuition around how the Fourier transform behaves in two dimensions.

Imagine a rectangle that’s centered at the origin. It has a total width of capital X along the x-axis, and a total height of capital Y along the y-axis. The function value is constant — say, equal to 1 — inside this rectangle, and zero outside.

We now take the 2D Fourier transform of this rectangle. The formula looks a bit dense, but the steps are straightforward.

We start with the double integral of the original function times the complex exponential — e to the power minus j 2 pi times the quantity u x plus v y. That’s the standard definition of the 2D Fourier transform.
Since the function is separable — meaning it depends independently on x and y — we can break the double integral into two parts:
one over x, and one over y.
Evaluating each of these integrals separately gives us a product of two expressions.
Each part turns into a sinc function. In the x-direction, we get sin of pi times X u over pi X u — that’s sinc of pi X u. And in the y-direction, it’s sinc of pi Y v.

So the full 2D Fourier transform ends up as the product of these two sinc functions — one in the u-direction, and one in the v-direction — scaled by the area of the original rectangle, which is X times Y.
Now if you look at the plot here, you’ll see a 3D surface that shows the magnitude of the Fourier transform — the peak is at the center, and the ripples decay outward. That shape comes directly from the sinc functions.

Why are we showing this?
Because it mirrors the result we saw earlier: when a rectangular function is defined in one domain — here it’s the spatial domain — its transform becomes a sinc function in the other domain — in this case, the frequency domain.
This is closely related to the idea we discussed on the previous slide, where the rectangle — or gate — was in the frequency domain, and its transform was a sinc function in time. Whether you go forward or inverse, the core relationship stays similar.
So while this example is technically a bit different — it’s 2D, and it’s a forward transform — the intuition still applies. Rectangles and sinc functions are transform pairs. And we use that fact again and again in signal processing and imaging.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

39,"Now, let’s continue line by line and see how each step connects.
We’re now looking at this part of the derivation — specifically the fourth equation on the slide.

Here, we have the product of two terms:
a sinc function, written as sine of pi P t over pi P t,
and the convolution with another function in square brackets.
Let’s first focus on the sinc part. This comes from taking the inverse Fourier transform of the rectangular function in the frequency domain — the gate function we introduced earlier. When we take its inverse Fourier transform, we get a sinc function in the time domain. That’s because a rectangle in frequency always corresponds to a sinc in time. So that’s where this sine of pi P t over pi P t comes from — it’s our sinc kernel.

Now, let’s turn to the function inside the brackets.
Here, we’re performing an inverse Fourier transform on the product of two terms:
the Fourier transform of our original function,
and a periodic impulse train in frequency, with spacing capital P.
By the convolution theorem, multiplying two functions in the frequency domain is equivalent to convolving their inverse transforms in the time domain. So we convolve the original function f of t with the inverse transform of this impulse train in the frequency domain.

And what is the inverse transform of a periodic impulse train in frequency?
It gives us another periodic impulse train — this time in time — with spacing equal to one over capital P. So this entire expression simplifies to f of t convolved with a sum of shifted delta functions, spaced by one over P.
We can express that more clearly on the next line. The equation now becomes:
f of t equals sinc of pi P t multiplied by the sum over all k from minus infinity to infinity of f of t times delta of t minus k over P.
And because convolution with a delta function simply samples the function, this expression simplifies further — giving us the familiar formula for signal reconstruction.

So finally, we arrive at the last equation on this slide:
f of t equals the sum over k, from negative to positive infinity,of f evaluated at k over P,times sinc of pi times the quantity t minus k over P.
This is the reconstruction formula for band-limited signals. It tells us that if the signal was sampled at or above the Nyquist rate — meaning no aliasing occurred — then we can recover the original continuous function perfectly by summing shifted sinc functions, each scaled by the sampled value.

That’s the power of the sampling theorem. It doesn’t just allow us to digitize signals — it tells us exactly how to recover them.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

40,"Now let’s take a moment to talk about an important concept in signal processing — the comb function and how it behaves under the Fourier transform.

Let’s start with this equation at the top. It says:
s of t equals the sum over all n of delta of t minus n times capital T.
This is what we call a delta train or comb function in the time domain. It’s a series of impulses, evenly spaced by T units.
Now, when we take the Fourier transform of this comb, something very elegant happens.
It becomes another comb — but in the frequency domain.

Specifically, the transform is:
s of f equals one over capital T times the sum over all n of delta of f minus n over capital T.
So, in words, a comb in time with spacing T becomes a comb in frequency with spacing 1 over T. And we get a scaling factor of 1 over T in front.
This is a fundamental symmetry in Fourier analysis: when a signal is periodic in time, its spectrum is discrete in frequency — and vice versa.

Now look at the plots in the middle of the slide.
On the left side, we see a train of impulses spaced T apart along the time axis. On the right, we have the corresponding Fourier transform — another train of impulses but now spaced 1 over T along the frequency axis.
So there’s this beautiful reciprocal relationship: if your delta train is spaced T in time, its Fourier counterpart is spaced 1 over T in frequency.
And this brings us to the red box at the bottom of the slide. These equations generalize the idea.

Let’s say you have a sum of delta functions shifted by n over P. That’s a comb with spacing 1 over P.
Then, its Fourier transform becomes P times a sum of delta functions spaced P apart. The scaling factor flips — one becomes P, and the spacing flips from 1 over P to P.
And if we put a scaling factor of 1 over P in front of the comb, then the Fourier transform is simply a comb with spacing P, with no extra scaling factor.
So again, delta trains are their own Fourier transforms — up to a scaling and spacing change.

This property is essential when we talk about sampling, because whenever we sample a signal, we’re essentially multiplying it by a comb function in time. And that multiplication creates repeated spectra in the frequency domain — spaced according to the sampling rate.
So that’s the comb and its mirror — one of the most powerful dualities in Fourier theory.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

41,"Now let’s focus on the last few steps of the derivation and clarify what’s happening here, line by line.
Previously, we had the convolution of two time-domain signals: one was a sinc function, the other was a sum of scaled impulses. That brought us to this expression:
f of t equals sinc of pi P t, divided by pi P t, convolved with the sum from k equals minus infinity to infinity of f of t times delta of t minus k over P.
Let’s unpack that.
First, remember that this sum is what we call a delta train — an infinite series of delta functions spaced at intervals of 1 over P.

Now you might ask — wait a minute, where did the 1 over P factor go?
Good observation.
Originally, the delta train had a scaling factor of 1 over P. But earlier in the derivation, we also had a P multiplying the sinc function. So those two terms — P and 1 over P — cancel out. That’s why we don’t see the 1 over P anymore in the final expression.

So what do we have now?
We have a continuous function — that’s the sinc — multiplying a series of impulses that are sampling the original function at regular intervals.
This is the essence of the sampling process.
The function f of t is being sampled at every t equals k over P, and the result is a series of weighted sinc functions. Each one is centered at t equals k over P and scaled by the corresponding sample value, f of k over P.
And that brings us to the final expression:
f of t equals the sum from k equals minus infinity to infinity of f of k over P, multiplied by sinc of pi P times t minus k over P, divided by pi P times t minus k over P.
That’s the sampling theorem.

It tells us that if a signal is band-limited — that is, its frequency content is restricted — then we can reconstruct the entire continuous-time signal exactly from its samples, as long as the sampling rate is high enough.
Each sample contributes a scaled sinc function, and the sum of all those sinc functions reconstructs the original signal.
This formula is both elegant and powerful — and it lies at the foundation of all modern digital signal processing.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

42,"Let’s take a step back now and look at how analog signals are converted to digital.
At the top, we have a smooth, continuous signal — this is your analog signal — represented here as f of t, where t is time.

Now, to digitize this signal, we begin with the process of sampling. In the middle plot, you see a train of delta functions — these are evenly spaced impulses in time. Each one of them marks a point where we will sample the analog signal.

Next, what do we do?
We multiply the continuous signal by this train of impulses. That’s shown in the bottom figure.
This multiplication essentially picks out the values of the original signal at those discrete time points — and sets everything else to zero. In other words, it’s like punching holes in the continuous function, keeping only the values at regular intervals.
The result is a series of weighted impulses, where the height of each spike corresponds to the signal’s value at that instant.
And this is the essence of analog-to-digital conversion.

We’ve turned a smooth, continuous-time signal into a discrete-time representation — something that can now be stored, processed, and transmitted digitally.
This is the first key step in digital signal processing — and it's entirely grounded in the mathematics of the sampling theorem we just discussed.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

43,"Now let’s focus on this final and very important step.
What you see here is the reconstruction formula — a powerful result that tells us how to rebuild the original continuous-time signal, f of t, from its discrete samples.
Here’s how it works.

We start with a set of sampled values. These are the values of f of t taken at regular intervals — specifically at times k over P. These are the points where our delta functions were placed during sampling.

Now, we take each of those sampled values — each f of k over P — and multiply it by a special function called the sinc function. You can see it written here as sine of pi times P times t minus k over P divided by pi times P times t minus k over P.
This sinc function looks like a smooth oscillating wave that decays gradually away from its center. And what’s important is that it has the perfect shape to reconstruct smooth curves from discrete data points.

Now here’s the key idea.
Each sampled value acts like a weight, and each weight generates a shifted copy of the sinc function centered at that sample point. So at k over P, we get a sinc function that peaks there, scaled by the sample value at that point.
Then we add up all these sinc functions — one for each sample.

The result? A continuous, smooth signal — which is exactly the original signal f of t that we started with.
This is how sampling and reconstruction come together. Each delta function ""copies"" the sinc function. Each copy is scaled by the corresponding sample value. And the sum of all these scaled sinc functions recreates the original analog signal.
So this final formula — this infinite sum — tells us something remarkable:
As long as we sample carefully, we can fully reconstruct a continuous signal from just its discrete samples.
That’s the beauty of the sampling theorem.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:

44,"To wrap up our discussion, let’s take a closer look at this final visual — it ties everything together beautifully.
At the top, we see a simple rectangular function, labeled f of x. It’s a block function centered at zero. Next to it is h of x, which is a train of two delta functions — one at minus a over two and the other at plus a over two. Their amplitudes are scaled by one-half.

Now, when we convolve f of x with h of x, the result — g of x — is essentially just two shifted copies of the original function. Each delta acts like a copying machine, reproducing f of x at the location of the delta. This is a perfect illustration of how convolution with delta functions results in replicated versions of a signal.

Now let’s look at the bottom half of the slide — we’re moving into the frequency domain.
The Fourier transform of the original block function, f of x, becomes a smooth sinc-like curve, F of k. The delta train, h of x, transforms into a cosine wave pattern, H of k. And the product in the frequency domain, F of k times H of k, gives us G of k — a modulated version of the original Fourier transform.
This shows us that convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain — one of the central results of Fourier theory.

Now, relating this back to the sampling theorem...
When we sample a continuous signal, we are essentially multiplying it by a train of delta functions. In the time domain, this multiplication picks out the values at those sampling points. But in the frequency domain, it leads to repetitions — or aliases — of the original spectrum.
And when we reconstruct, we don't use the simple rectangle anymore — instead, we use the sinc function, which is the Fourier transform of an ideal low-pass filter. But the principle is the same: the delta functions trigger copies, and these copies are scaled by the actual sample values — f of k over P.

And here’s the key takeaway:
If we sample fast enough — meaning at more than twice the highest frequency in the original signal — and if the signal is band-limited, then all those sinc functions will line up perfectly, and we can fully recover the original signal.
That’s the heart of the sampling theorem. It’s not just an abstract formula — it’s a practical method that allows us to move between continuous and digital signals with full confidence.

45,"Let’s now take a moment to revisit a topic that you’ve likely seen before — linear systems.

Here, we’re looking at the classic equation: A x equals b.That’s a system of linear equations, where A is your matrix, x is the unknown vector, and b is the observed result or measurement.
Now, solving for x in this system is something you’ve probably done many times before — especially if you've worked through a textbook like Elementary Linear Algebra by Howard Anton, shown here.

But here's the key question for us:What if the unknown vector x is sparse?
In other words, what if most of the elements in x are actually zero — and only a few are nonzero?
This situation comes up a lot in modern signal processing and imaging. We no longer assume that a signal is densely sampled or has energy spread all over. Instead, we often find that signals have a sparse structure, especially when we represent them in a suitable basis, like wavelets or gradients.

Now, here’s where it gets really interesting — and this is where modern theory breaks free from traditional Nyquist sampling.
Instead of sampling a signal very densely — at twice its maximum frequency — we can sample much more sparsely, and still recover the full signal.

How?
We change our assumption.Instead of assuming the signal is band-limited, we assume it's sparse in some transform domain. Maybe it's sparse in the wavelet domain, or maybe the total variation is small — meaning the signal changes smoothly, or only has a few sharp transitions.
Then, among all possible solutions that match the measurements, we choose the sparsest one.

This is the idea behind compressed sensing, and it has revolutionized the way we think about sampling and recovery.
So that green button on the slide — it’s there to say: pause and think. This is a major shift in the traditional mindset. It opens the door to powerful new methods for signal reconstruction from limited data — especially in imaging and beyond.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
46,"Let’s take a step further and talk about a powerful idea that shows up across science and engineering — and that’s sparsity.
You can see the green button here, which means this concept is important, but it’s okay if the details feel abstract for now. Just follow the intuition.

Traditionally, signal processing has focused on signals that are band-limited — which means their frequencies don’t go beyond a certain point. Based on that assumption, we rely on Nyquist sampling: sample at least twice the maximum frequency, and you can perfectly reconstruct the signal.

But what if we go beyond that assumption?
Modern theory says: you don’t always need to sample that densely. Instead of requiring a signal to be band-limited, we assume that it’s sparse in some domain. That means — in the right representation, most of the values are zero, or nearly zero.
Think about images. They may look complex, but when you apply a wavelet transform — like the ones shown in the graphics — most of the wavelet coefficients are close to zero. Only a few carry meaningful information. This is sparsity.
On the left, we have an illustration from the book Wavelets in Physics. It shows how signals in physics often exhibit localized spikes — sparse behavior. In the center and top-right, you see surfaces where most values are flat or close to zero, with just a few sharp peaks — again, sparse structure.

Even in biology — like the cellular structure of a leaf — patterns emerge that are spatially compact and repeated. This biological system, shown on the right, is highly structured and organized. And this kind of structure is often sparse when expressed in the right basis.

Now, here’s why sparsity matters.
If you don’t have enough measurements to fully determine a signal — that is, if your system is underdetermined — then infinitely many solutions could explain the data. But if you know the signal is sparse, you can ask: among all possible solutions, which one is the sparsest?
That’s the central idea behind compressed sensing.
By assuming sparsity, and by choosing the solution with the fewest nonzero components, you can accurately recover the original signal — even from very limited data.

So this concept — sparsity — is not just a mathematical trick. It’s something we see everywhere: in physics, in images, in biology, and in many natural and engineered systems. Recognizing it gives us a powerful way to reconstruct signals and solve problems more efficiently than ever before.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

47,"Alright, let’s wrap up with the big picture.

This slide summarizes the key relationships between time and frequency domains — especially how signals and their spectra behave when we move from continuous to discrete representations.
At the very top left, we start with a continuous-time signal — a smooth pulse that exists over a limited time interval. On the right, we see its frequency content, also confined to a certain bandwidth.

Now, as we go down the slide, we perform sampling in time. That’s the red comb of vertical lines. We're picking values from the original signal at regular intervals — let’s say every delta t.
What does this do in the frequency domain?
It creates multiple copies of the spectrum, repeated again and again. This is called spectral replication. And if these replications don’t overlap, we can perfectly reconstruct the original signal.
That's the essence of the sampling theorem — to avoid distortion, we must sample fast enough, at least twice the highest frequency present in the signal.

Now, let’s look at the lower half of the slide.
Here, we’re sampling in the frequency domain instead. That’s shown by the green comb — regularly spaced frequency spikes.
What happens to the signal in the time domain?
It becomes periodic — the original signal now repeats over time, again and again.

So the big idea is this:
Sampling in time causes replication in frequency.
Sampling in frequency causes repetition in time.
These two processes mirror each other — one in time, the other in frequency. This duality is at the heart of signal processing.
Now, I know this diagram is dense, but if you walk through it carefully — step by step — you’ll see how everything we’ve covered comes together.

3,"In our last lecture, we examined the sampling theorem in detail, focusing on key concepts such as the sampling rate and the Nyquist rate. By now, you should have a clear idea of why, under certain conditions, we can perfectly recover a continuous signal from its sampled version.

Here’s the key idea:We start with a continuous signal, f of t, shown here. When we sample it at regular time intervals — let's call that interval delta-t — we obtain a discrete sequence of values. The sampling theorem tells us that, if certain conditions are met, we can reconstruct the original continuous signal from these samples without losing any information.

That’s remarkable — because even though we only record values at specific time points, and there’s “missing” information in between, the theorem guarantees perfect recovery. But this only works if the original signal’s Fourier transform is band-limited. That means its frequency spectrum is essentially zero outside a certain range, from minus w to plus w.

In the frequency domain, sampling corresponds to a convolution between the original continuous Fourier spectrum and a periodic train of delta functions. This delta train in frequency comes from the Fourier transform of the impulse train in time. The spacing between the deltas in frequency — which we’ll call P — is the reciprocal of the sampling interval delta-t.

To avoid any distortion, P must be at least 2 W. This ensures there is no overlap between the repeated copies of the spectrum in the frequency domain. You can think of each delta function as a “copying machine” — each one shifts and reproduces the original spectrum at regular intervals. If the copies don’t overlap, the original information is preserved perfectly.

In practice, we can apply a low-pass filter to keep only the central copy of the spectrum, then perform an inverse Fourier transform to reconstruct the exact original signal.

Now, a small note about the special case where P equals exactly 2 W: here, the copies just touch at a single point. This doesn’t cause problems unless that single point is a delta function with a finite value — in which case it could contribute to the result. But in most practical signals, that single point has no significant effect.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
4,"Now let’s look at the special case where P equals exactly 2 w.

Suppose our continuous signal is a pure sine wave with a frequency of 1 hertz. That means it completes exactly one cycle in one second. In the frequency domain, this is a band-limited signal — its maximum frequency is 1 hertz.
If we sample at exactly twice that frequency — so at 2 hertz — we meet the Nyquist rate exactly. In this case, we take two samples within each cycle. For a pure sinusoid, two unknowns fully describe it: the amplitude and the phase. In theory, two samples per cycle should be enough to determine those two unknowns.

However, here’s the problem. Depending on where the samples fall, we might end up with the exact same sample value each time — for example, always sampling at the zero crossings of the sine wave. In that case, all our samples would be zero, and we would have no reliable way to determine the original signal.

In the Fourier domain, a pure sine wave corresponds to a pair of delta functions located at its positive and negative frequency components. When we sample at exactly 2 w, the duplicated spectra in the frequency domain just touch each other. If the touching points happen to be delta functions, those deltas overlap, and we can no longer separate the contributions from each one. Mathematically, it’s like having the equation X plus Y equals C — you know the sum, but not the individual values. This is an aliasing problem.

That’s why, in practice, sampling exactly at 2 w is risky. To be safe, we require PPP — the spacing between repeated spectra in frequency — to be slightly greater than 2 w. In other words, the sampling rate should be a little higher than twice the maximum frequency in the signal. This extra margin ensures that no overlap occurs, and reconstruction remains reliable.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

5,"Here, we have the whole derivation of the sampling theorem summarized on one page.

You see a few steps underlined in red. These are the important turning points in the math — the places where something key happens. In a detailed lecture, we would walk through each of them slowly, but here, I want to focus on the big picture.
We start in the frequency domain, where the spectrum of our signal is multiplied by a periodic train of impulses. When we bring this back to the time domain, that multiplication turns into a convolution. The result of that convolution involves a special function called “sinc,” which naturally appears when you take the Fourier transform of a rectangular shape in frequency.

Next, when we write out the convolution, we see it as an infinite sum — a series of shifted sinc functions. Each one is scaled by the value of our signal at a sample point. The distance between these samples is delta-t, and that’s simply one over P, the spacing in the frequency domain.

The final line is the famous Shannon interpolation formula. In words, it says: take each sample of your signal, put a sinc function centered at that sample, scale it by the sample’s value, and then add them all together. Do this for every sample — stretching infinitely in both directions — and you get your original continuous signal back exactly, as long as the sampling conditions are satisfied.

This is a beautiful result. It tells us that perfect reconstruction is not just possible — it’s a direct consequence of the sampling theorem. And this formula is one of the core foundations of all digital signal processing.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

6,"Let’s look at a good case — when our sampling rate is high enough to meet the sampling theorem’s requirement.

The black curve here is our original, continuous signal. Think of it as the “true” signal. The blue points show where we took our samples — a limited number of values, spaced evenly in time.

Here’s the magic: if the sampling rate is greater than twice the maximum frequency in the signal — the Nyquist rate — then we can take these discrete samples and use the Shannon interpolation formula to reconstruct the original signal perfectly.
When we do that here, the reconstructed signal (shown in red) lies exactly on top of the original black curve. They match so perfectly that you can’t even see the difference.

This is the sampling theorem in action. For band-limited signals, as long as we sample fast enough, we can go back and forth between continuous and discrete forms without losing information. You can repeat this process over and over, with different sample sets, and it will work every time.
In short — with the right sampling rate, theory and practice agree perfectly.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

7,"Now, here’s a bad case — when the sampling rate is too low.

The black curve is again our original, continuous signal. The blue points are where we took our samples. And the red curve is what we get when we try to reconstruct the signal from those samples.
At the sample locations, the reconstructed red curve passes exactly through the blue points — so it matches the original at those specific spots. But between the sample points, the red curve drifts far away from the true black signal.

This mismatch is caused by aliasing. Because our sampling rate is less than twice the maximum frequency in the signal, the repeated spectra in the frequency domain overlap. That overlap distorts the information, and once it happens, no amount of interpolation can recover the original shape.

So, while the reconstruction looks fine exactly at the sampled points, the continuous waveform in between is completely wrong. This is why respecting the sampling theorem is essential — if you don’t sample fast enough, the damage is permanent.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

8,"Let’s step back and see the big picture.

There are really two parts here. On the top half, we have discretized the signal in the time domain. This means we start with a continuous signal, sample it at regular intervals, and get a discrete set of values — something we can store and process in a digital computer. If the sampling theorem is satisfied, this step causes no information loss.
But the story doesn’t end there. Even though our signal is now discrete in time, its Fourier spectrum is still continuous. And a continuous spectrum cannot be stored directly in a computer either.

That’s where the second part comes in — discretizing the spectrum. This is the central topic of this lecture. The idea is to take the continuous Fourier spectrum and multiply it by a periodic train of delta functions in the frequency domain. This multiplication in frequency corresponds to convolution in the time domain, which effectively copies our time-domain signal over and over again, spaced apart by a fixed period t.

In other words, sampling in one domain causes repetition — or duplication — in the other domain. When we discretize both the time-domain signal and the frequency-domain spectrum, we end up with a periodic structure in both domains.
The key point here is that now, both our signal in time and its spectrum in frequency are discrete and periodic. This makes them fully compatible with digital processing. And this is the foundation for moving toward the discrete Fourier transform.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

9,"Signal sampling is a fundamental concept, but it can be confusing if you only look at it quickly. So let’s slow down and really understand it.
At the top, we have our continuous signal, f x. This is defined for every value of x and could represent anything — a sound wave, an image profile, or a measured signal.

Next, we have what’s called a Shah function, or an impulse train. This is simply a series of delta functions, each spaced t units apart. Mathematically, it’s written as the sum of delta functions, where each one is located at x equals n T, with n being an integer. You can think of this impulse train as a ruler that marks the exact points where we’ll take our samples.

When we multiply the continuous signal f of x by this impulse train, we get the sampled function. This multiplication is done point-by-point: at each delta function’s location, we keep the value of f of x; everywhere else, the result is zero.
So the sampled signal is really the original signal’s values, “attached” to the impulses in the train. The impulses mark the positions, and the heights of the impulses carry the signal’s values at those positions.

In other words, the sampled function is just the original function, but only at discrete, regularly spaced points. This is the first step in moving from the continuous world to the digital world.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

10,"When we sample a signal in the time domain — or the spatial domain — it creates a very specific effect in the frequency domain. Sampling in one domain is equivalent to performing a convolution in the other domain.

Let’s walk through it.We start with our original spectrum, which we’ll call F of u. Here, u represents frequency, and u-max is the highest frequency present in the signal — its bandwidth.
When we multiply our signal in time by an impulse train — a set of regularly spaced spikes — that multiplication turns into a convolution in frequency. The result is that the original spectrum gets repeated again and again, spaced apart by the sampling frequency.

In this diagram, the middle shape is the original spectrum. To the left and right, you can see identical copies. The spacing between them is one over capital T, where capital T is the sampling interval in time.
If our sampling frequency — which is one over T — is at least twice the maximum frequency in the signal, then these repeated copies don’t touch each other. In that case, we can simply keep the central copy and reconstruct the original signal perfectly.

But if we sample too slowly, the copies overlap. This overlap distorts the spectrum, and once that happens, there’s no way to separate the original from the distortion. That’s the aliasing problem we saw in the earlier “bad case” example.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.
Extract:
1. ..."
11,"Here’s the Nyquist theorem in action.

In the diagram, you can see the original spectrum and its repeated copies created by sampling. If our sampling rate is too low, these copies start to overlap. When that happens, the frequency components from one copy mix with those from another. This is aliasing — and once it occurs, we can’t tell which part of the spectrum came from the original signal and which part came from the overlap.

To avoid aliasing, we must make sure that the highest frequency in the signal — we call it u-max — is less than one divided by twice the sampling interval. In spoken terms, the sampling frequency must be greater than twice u-max. This threshold is called the Nyquist frequency.

When the condition is satisfied, we can use a rectangular filter — often called a gate function — to select just the central copy of the spectrum. That single copy contains all the information needed to perfectly reconstruct the original signal.
It’s like DNA testing — you don’t need the whole organism, just a small sample, because it contains the complete blueprint. In the same way, one clean copy of the spectrum contains everything we need.

But if the sampling rate is too low and overlap happens, no filter can separate the mixed components. The information is lost forever.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

12,"Now let’s see why aliasing makes recovery non-unique.

In this diagram, the red and blue curves represent two different sets of frequency components. When aliasing happens, these components overlap in the frequency domain. At the points where they overlap, what we measure is just the sum of their values.
For example, imagine that at a certain frequency, the blue component has a value of A, and the red component also has some value. When they overlap, all we see is their sum. That means many different combinations of blue and red could produce the exact same total.

In other words, you can’t tell exactly how much came from the blue curve and how much came from the red one. The information about their contributions is lost.
This is why aliasing is such a problem — once two spectra overlap, there is no unique way to separate them. No matter how you process the data, you can’t reconstruct the original spectrum with certainty.

That’s why the Nyquist theorem’s condition — sampling faster than twice the highest frequency — is so important. It prevents this kind of overlap, keeping the spectrum unique and recoverable.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

13,"Up to this point, we’ve been talking about aliasing and how to avoid it. Let’s now assume we’ve done that — our sampling rate is always high enough, and the spectra are well separated. Aliasing is no longer an issue.

On the top row, you see our original continuous-time signal on the left. On the right, it’s been sampled — we now have a series of discrete values at regular time intervals.

On the bottom row, you see what this means in the frequency domain. On the left is the original spectrum, limited to a maximum frequency, u-max. On the right is the sampled spectrum — multiple, non-overlapping copies, spaced apart by the sampling frequency, which is one over capital T.

So yes, the signal is now discrete in time, and its spectrum is nicely replicated without overlap. But our job isn’t finished yet. The spectrum is still continuous in frequency. And if we want to fully digitize the signal — so that both the time domain and the frequency domain are discrete — we still have another step to go.
That step is discretizing the spectrum, which is exactly where we’re heading next.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

14,"Now that our signal is discrete in time and aliasing is avoided, the next step is to discretize the Fourier spectrum.
On the right, we start with the continuous, periodic Fourier spectrum of our sampled signal. The peaks are separated because our time-domain sampling rate was high enough. That’s good — no overlap here.

Our goal is to make the frequency domain discrete as well. To do that, we multiply the spectrum by a periodic train of impulses — shown here in green. This is just like what we did before in the time domain, but now we’re applying it in the frequency domain.
Multiplication in the frequency domain corresponds to convolution in the time domain. So, when we apply this green impulse train to the spectrum, the effect in the time domain is that our discrete signal gets duplicated at regular intervals, spaced by capital T.
Here, delta-u — the spacing between impulses in the frequency domain — equals one over capital T, where capital T is the period of each repeated signal in the time domain.

As before, we must choose our frequency-domain sampling rate carefully. The impulses in frequency must be close enough together — in other words, our spacing delta-u must be small enough — to avoid overlaps in the time domain. This is the same logic as before, just in the other domain.

By doing this, we end up with a signal that is discrete in both the time domain and the frequency domain. This is the essential step that brings us to the discrete Fourier transform, or DFT.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

15,"Let’s restate the big idea in another way.

We start with a continuous function in the time domain, which we’ll call f of t. It has a continuous Fourier transform, capital F of u, in the frequency domain. These two are perfectly related — one can be transformed into the other with no loss of information.

Now, if we sample f of t at the Nyquist rate or higher, we get a discrete version of the signal — here shown as g of t. And because our sampling rate satisfies the theorem, there’s no loss of information in moving from the continuous signal to its discrete version.
That discrete-time signal, g of t, also has its own Fourier transform — here represented as capital G of u. And again, as long as we have sampled properly, this discrete spectrum contains the same information as the continuous spectrum, capital F of u.

The key point is that the Fourier transform is an invertible process. That means moving from f of t to capital F of u, or from g of t to capital G of u, can be done in either direction without losing information — as long as the sampling theorem is respected.

So whether we choose to work in the continuous domain or in the discrete domain, we can perform equivalent signal analysis. The difference is that in the real world, our computers are digital. That means we do everything in the discrete domain — but thanks to the theory, we can be confident that our results match what we would get in the continuous world.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

16,"Let’s now bring everything together in one big picture, but with a bit more detail.

We start with a continuous function, f of t, and its continuous Fourier spectrum, capital F of u. Our goal is to sample both the time domain and the frequency domain in a way that makes sense for digital processing.

First, let’s ask: how many samples will we have in the time domain?
This depends on two things:
The sampling interval in time, delta-t. This is equal to one over capital P, where capital P is the spacing in the frequency domain. The smaller the delta-t, the more data points we collect.
The total duration of the signal, capital T. The longer we record, the more samples we have.
The total number of samples in the time domain — call it N — is simply the total duration T divided by delta-t. Since delta-t is one over P.

We can write:N equals T multiplied by P.
Now let’s switch to the frequency domain.
Here, the total span of one period in frequency is capital P. The sampling interval in frequency, delta-u, is equal to one over capital T. So the total number of samples in frequency over one period — call it M — is the total span P divided by delta-u. That’s again P multiplied by T.
This symmetry is important:The number of data points in the time domain and the number of data points in the frequency domain are the same — both equal to P multiplied by T.

So whether we’re sampling in time or in frequency, the total number of samples is determined by the product of the total span in one domain and the sampling density in the other.

This is the balanced relationship that underlies the discrete Fourier transform, and it’s why we can move between time and frequency representations so efficiently in digital signal processing.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

17,"Now let’s highlight the key variables and the important relationship between them.

In the time domain, the total number of samples is T times P. Here, capital T is the total duration of the signal, and capital P is the spacing in the frequency domain. So we have N equal to T multiplied by P.
In the frequency domain, we have the exact same number of samples, also T multiplied by P. We call this number M, and here P is the total span of one period in frequency, while T controls the sampling density in frequency.

If we take the reciprocal of N, we get a very useful relationship:1 over N equals delta-t times delta-u,where delta-t is the sampling step size in time, and delta-u is the sampling step size in frequency.
This is an expression of the duality between time and frequency. If we fix the total number of samples N, making delta-t smaller — meaning we sample more finely in time — will make delta-u larger, meaning the frequency samples are spaced farther apart. And the reverse is also true.

In simple terms: if you zoom in more on one domain, you automatically zoom out in the other. This balance is built into the mathematics of the Fourier transform and is something we’ll use later when we look at applications.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

18,"Now we’re ready to move from the continuous Fourier transform to the discrete Fourier transform.

When we sample a continuous signal, it stops being a smooth curve that exists at every moment in time. Instead, it becomes the product of the original signal and a series of equally spaced spikes — what we call delta functions. These spikes occur at time intervals of delta-t, which means each spike is separated by one divided by capital P in time. In other words, we only keep the signal’s value at these regular time points, and everywhere else is zero.

We can describe this mathematically as a sum of delta spikes. Each spike occurs at a time equal to n divided by P, where n goes from zero up to N minus one. The height of each spike is simply the value of the original signal at that time. You can imagine it as a row of vertical lines, each carrying the amplitude of the signal at its sampling point.
This gives us the discrete version of the signal in the time domain. Even though it’s just a set of separate values, it still represents a function of time, so we can take its Fourier transform.

When we do that, the Fourier transform turns into a sum over all the sampled points. The oscillating factor — what we call the kernel — still has the form “e to the power of minus j times two-pi times the frequency u times n divided by P,” but now we only evaluate it at those sampled time points.

The outcome is what we call the direct Fourier transform of the sampled signal. This is how we connect the continuous theory to the practical, digital form of the discrete Fourier transform that we use in computation.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

19,"The discrete Fourier transform we just discussed is actually a periodic function. Let’s understand why.

Think back to the Fourier series. In the time domain, a Fourier series is built from sinusoidal components — each one a sine or cosine wave. And by definition, each of these components is periodic. Whether we have just one frequency or many, the result will still be periodic.

Now, in this expression at the top, the left-hand side shows the Fourier series in the time domain, with terms involving t over capital T. On the right-hand side, we have an almost identical formula — but here the variable t has been replaced by u, and T has been replaced by P. This tells us that in the frequency domain, we also get a periodic function.

The periodicity comes directly from the fact that the Fourier transform of a sampled signal is made up of these repeating sinusoidal components. Each one repeats over and over, giving us a continuous function in the frequency domain that is also periodic.
This is exactly what we saw in the big picture earlier: when we sample in one domain, the Fourier transform becomes periodic in the other domain.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

20,"Up to now, we’ve mostly talked about sampling in the time domain. But we can also sample directly in the Fourier domain.

Let’s start with the Fourier transform of our signal, f-hat of u. If we multiply this spectrum by a train of delta functions in the frequency domain — just like we did earlier in the time domain — we get a sampled version of the spectrum. That means we only keep its values at certain frequency points, which we can label as u-zero, u-one, all the way up to u (N minus 1).
Here, the spacing between these frequency samples is 1 over capital T, where capital T is the period in the time domain. The index m runs from zero to N minus one, just like it did in the time-domain case. And the total number of samples in the frequency domain is the same as in the time domain — both equal to capital N.

Mathematically, we can write the sampled spectrum at position u m as a sum over all the time-domain samples f of n over P, multiplied by a complex exponential. The exponent has a nice symmetry: it’s e to the power of minus j, 2 pi, n times m, divided by capital N.

This symmetry is important — it shows that sampling in the Fourier domain has exactly the same mathematical structure as sampling in the time domain. The formulas look almost identical, just with the roles of time and frequency swapped.

This parallel is one of the reasons the discrete Fourier transform is so elegant — it’s the same process, whether you’re thinking in terms of time samples or frequency samples.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

21,"Now we can state the discrete Fourier transform 

We’ve sampled the signal at timest n equals to n divided by capital P, for n equals to 0, 1, …, N minus 1.We’ll read the spectrum at frequenciesu m equals to m divided by capital T, for m equals to 0, 1, …, N minus 1,with N equals to T times P.

The DFT value at u m is
“sum from n equals zero to N minus one, f of n over P, into e to the power of minus j, two pi, m n over N.”
This is just an inner product with a complex sinusoid of frequency index m.Each output is complex: its magnitude tells us how much of that frequency is present, and its angle (the phase) tells us the shift.

A few quick anchors:
t n equals to n over P are the time samples.
u m equals to m over T are the frequency samples.
The exponential “e to the minus j two pi m n over N” is the rotating basis wave.

Next, we’ll write the inverse DFT and see why a factor of one over N naturally appears so we can reconstruct the time samples exactly.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

22,"Up to now, we’ve been writing our time samples as t-zero, t-one, t-two, and so on, and our frequency samples as u-zero, u-one, u-two, and so on. But when we work with sampled data, what really matters are the integer positions of these samples.

So, to make things simpler, we’ll label them using integers in square brackets. For example:
f of zero means the value of the function at time sample t-zero.
f of one means the value at time sample t-one.
f of N minus one means the value at the last time sample, t N minus one.
We do the same in the frequency domain:
f-hat of zero means the Fourier transform value at frequency sample u-zero.
f-hat of one is at u-one.
And so on, up to f-hat of N minus one.

With this notation, the discrete Fourier transform reads like this:
f-hat of m  equals the sum from n equals zero to N minus one of f of n, multiplied by e to the power of minus j, two pi, m times n divided by N.
Here, n is the index for time-domain samples, and m is the index for frequency components.
Each term is just the sample value f of n  multiplied by a sinusoidal basis wave at frequency index m. Adding all those terms together gives the strength of that frequency in the signal — that’s our Fourier coefficient.

We can also see this as a matrix multiplication:
The time samples f of zero, f of one, …, f of N minus one form a column vector.
They are multiplied by an N-by-N matrix whose entries are these complex exponentials e to the power of minus j, two pi, m times n divided by N.
The result is another vector containing all the frequency samples f-hat of zero, f-hat of one, …, f-hat of N minus one.
For the first frequency index, m equals zero, every exponential equals one, so the first Fourier coefficient is simply the sum of all the time samples.

Later, we’ll talk about scaling factors to account for the sampling step size, but for now this integer-index form keeps the DFT definition clean and easy to use.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

23,"Once we have all the discrete Fourier coefficients — that is, f-hat of m  for m equals zero up to N minus one — we can recover the original sampled signal values f of n  by using the inverse discrete Fourier transform.

In words, the formula says:
f of n  equals one over capital N, times the sum from m equals zero to N minus one of f-hat of m, multiplied by e to the power of plus j, two pi, m times n divided by N.
Here, n is the time-sample index, and m is the frequency-sample index.
The plus sign in the exponent is important — it’s the opposite of the minus sign we used in the forward discrete Fourier transform. This sign change is what allows us to reverse the process.

The factor of one over capital N also plays a key role. When we computed f-hat of zero in the forward transform, we were summing all the time samples, but we didn’t average them. This factor in the inverse transform takes care of that averaging, so we get the correct values back.
Some people prefer a symmetric version: instead of putting all the scaling in the inverse transform, they split it evenly — using one over the square root of N in both the forward and inverse formulas. This is purely a matter of definition; the math works either way.

You can also see this in matrix form:
In the forward transform, we multiply the time-sample vector by the Fourier matrix of complex exponentials.
In the inverse transform, we multiply the frequency-sample vector by the inverse of that matrix, which has the plus sign in the exponent and the one over N factor out front.

With these two formulas — forward and inverse — we can move back and forth between a discretized time-domain signal and its discretized frequency-domain spectrum, with no information loss, as long as the sampling theorem was satisfied in the first place.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

24,"Let’s talk about why we have this factor of one over capital N in the inverse discrete Fourier transform.
Earlier, I mentioned that 1 over N is equal to delta-t times delta-u. Here, delta-t is the sampling interval in the time domain, and delta-u is the sampling interval in the frequency domain.

Think of it this way: when we move from the continuous Fourier transform to the discrete version, we’re replacing continuous integrals with sums. In the time domain, we can picture our original continuous function as being approximated by a collection of rectangles — each rectangle has a height equal to the sample value f of n , and a width of delta-t.
Likewise, in the frequency domain, the Fourier spectrum is also represented as a collection of rectangles — each one has a height equal to f-hat of m  and a width of delta-u.

When we go from the spectrum back to the signal, we’re essentially adding up all of these little rectangular pieces. The factor of delta-t times delta-u captures the combined effect of this discretization in both domains. And since 1 over N equals delta-t times delta-u, that’s why the factor appears in the inverse DFT.
This is the discrete equivalent of what happens in the continuous Fourier transform, where we also have a scaling factor in the inverse formula. The difference is that here, the scaling is tied directly to our sampling steps in both domains.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

25,"The factor of 1 over capital N comes directly from how the continuous Fourier transform becomes a discrete one when we sample.

In the continuous world, both the forward and inverse Fourier transforms are integrals. But when we digitize the process, we replace those integrals with sums. That’s what we see in this figure — the smooth area under the curve is replaced by a set of thin rectangular strips. Each strip has a height equal to the function value at a sample point, and a width equal to the sampling interval.
In the time domain, that width is delta-t, the spacing between time samples. In the frequency domain, it’s delta-u, the spacing between frequency samples.

When we perform a forward Fourier transform, the discretization introduces a factor of delta-t. When we perform the inverse transform, the discretization introduces a factor of delta-u. Multiply those together, and you get delta-t times delta-u — which we know is equal to one over capital N.
This is why, in the inverse discrete Fourier transform, we include the 1 over N factor — it accounts for both steps of discretization: first in time, then in frequency.

And remember, there’s one more difference between the forward and inverse formulas: the forward transform uses a minus sign in the exponent, and the inverse transform uses a plus sign. This sign change is what lets the two operations perfectly undo each other.
So, the 1 over N is there because of how sampling replaces integrals with sums in both domains. It’s the scaling factor that ensures the forward and inverse transforms work together exactly.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

26,"The second way to look at the discrete Fourier transform is from the perspective of harmonics.
When we do a forward DFT, we can think of it as multiplying our vector of time samples by a square matrix of complex exponentials. This matrix acts like a rotation in a high-dimensional space — it changes our coordinates from the time-domain representation to the frequency-domain representation.

The set of Fourier basis functions — the sinusoids at different discrete frequencies — form an orthonormal basis. That means they are all perpendicular to each other in this mathematical space. The forward transform rotates our coordinates from the “time axis” basis to the “frequency axis” basis. The inverse transform simply rotates them back.

This idea generalizes. In one dimension, the Fourier basis is just sines and cosines. But in two or three dimensions, or on a sphere, we can define more complex sinusoidal patterns, called harmonics. On a sphere, these are the spherical harmonics — each one corresponding to a certain “frequency” pattern over the surface.

The key property is the same: if you take two different harmonics and compute their inner product, the result is zero — they are orthogonal. If you take one harmonic and do an inner product with itself, you get one — it’s normalized.
So whether we are talking about simple sines and cosines, or more complex spherical harmonics, the Fourier transform is still just expressing a signal in terms of an orthogonal set of basis functions, then rotating between these bases.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

27,"Here we’re looking at a particular orthonormal basis used in Fourier analysis.

Our basis functions have the form:
e to the power of j, two pi, m times t divided by capital T
where m is the frequency index.
If we take two of these basis functions, one with index m and the other with index n, and compute their inner product — meaning we integrate the product of one and the complex conjugate of the other over the full interval from zero to capital T — two things can happen:

If m and n are different, the integral is zero. That means the functions are orthogonal — they share no common component.
If m and n are the same, the integral is one. That means each basis function has a unit norm, or length equal to one.
This is exactly what “orthonormal” means: the functions are orthogonal to each other, and each one has length one.

Because the Fourier basis has this orthonormal property, we can represent any signal as a sum of these basis functions without losing information. And we can go back and forth between the time-domain representation and the frequency-domain representation using the discrete Fourier transform and its inverse, knowing that the relationship is exact when the sampling theorem is satisfied.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

28,"What we see here is just another way to write the discrete Fourier transform and its inverse — same math, just different symbols. You’ll often see different papers or books use different notations, so it’s important to recognize that they all mean the same thing.

Let’s say we have N data points in the time domain. We’ll call them h k, where k runs from zero to N minus one. These are our measured samples — they could represent anything, such as temperature values taken at different times.

To get the frequency-domain representation, we compute H n, the Fourier coefficients, using the formula:
H n equals the sum from k equals zero to N minus one of h k times e to the power of minus j, two pi, k n divided by N.
This is the forward discrete Fourier transform. The minus sign in the exponent tells us we’re rotating our coordinates in one direction in this N-dimensional space.

The inverse transform takes us back from the frequency coefficients H n to the time samples h k:
h k equals one over N, times the sum from n equals zero to N minus one of H n times e to the power of plus j, two pi, k n divided by N.
Here, the plus sign in the exponent means we’re rotating back, and the factor of one over N is the scaling we discussed earlier — it accounts for the sampling steps in both time and frequency. Some definitions split the scaling evenly between the forward and inverse transforms to make them look perfectly symmetric, but that’s just a matter of convention.

The key points:
We have N samples, so we only need N orthogonal basis functions.
Those basis functions are harmonics whose frequencies differ by a constant increment.
The forward and inverse transforms are nearly symmetric — the main difference is the sign in the exponent and where we put the scaling factor.

From a computational point of view, each row of the Fourier transform matrix has N elements. To compute one Fourier coefficient, we do N multiplications and N additions. Since we have N coefficients to compute, the total work is proportional to N-squared.
This N-squared growth in computations was a big deal in the early days of signal processing, when N could be very large.

29,"The Fast Fourier Transform, or FFT, is an efficient algorithm for computing the discrete Fourier transform. It was published by Cooley and Tukey in 1965, and it completely changed the way we do signal processing.

To give you an idea of its impact, in 1969, analyzing 2,048 data points from a seismic trace using the standard DFT took more than 13 hours. Using the FFT on the exact same machine, the same analysis took just 2.4 seconds. That’s an enormous improvement.
I remember when I was in primary school, a 2,000-point seismic data analysis could take more than a full day to process. But with FFT, the same task could be finished in under three seconds.

This kind of speedup is critical in many applications, especially those that need real-time results — whether it’s analyzing signals from an airplane’s sensors, monitoring seismic activity, or performing real-time image reconstruction.
The reason FFT is so powerful is that it reduces the computational complexity.

A naive DFT requires about N-squared operations — that’s N multiplications and additions for each of the N outputs.
The FFT reduces this to N times log-base-2 of N operations.
That’s a huge difference. For example, if N is 1,000, the log-base-2 of N is about 10. So instead of doing a million operations, we only need about ten thousand. The larger N gets, the more dramatic the savings become.

Because of this efficiency, FFT still plays an essential role in modern signal processing, and it’s also widely used in areas like medical imaging, machine learning, and convolution-based computations.",[],[],"You are an expert assistant helping extract structured information from lecture slides.

30,"Because the inverse discrete Fourier transform is so similar to the forward transform, we can design a fast algorithm for it as well. This is called the inverse FFT, or IFFT.

In MATLAB, the fft function computes the forward FFT, and the ifft function computes the inverse FFT. For example, fft of X, N computes an N-point FFT. If the vector X has fewer than N points, it pads with zeros; if it has more, it truncates. The IFFT works the same way, just in reverse.

If we were to implement the Fourier transform exactly as in the mathematical definition, we would do a summation for each frequency index k. Each summation is essentially an inner product — it requires N multiplications and N additions. And we need to do this for each of the N output points. That’s N times N operations — N squared in total.
The FFT and IFFT are like built-in shortcuts. You don’t need to know all the details of how they work to use them — just like you don’t need to know how your phone connects to your friend when you press the call button. You can treat FFT and IFFT as black boxes: you give them the data, and they give you the result quickly and efficiently.
