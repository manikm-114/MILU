These methods are grounded in engineering, physics, and biomedicine.\n\nAnd this isn’t just about theory.

We can see the world around us, we can observe surfaces, recognize faces, navigate through our environment. But our vision is tied to visible light, and that means we can’t see through most objects. We don’t know what’s behind a wall, inside a box, or within our own bodies.\n\nThat’s where medical imaging comes in. It gives us the ability to look beyond the surface—to see inside the human body without making a single incision. This is what makes medical imaging so extraordinary. It extends our natural vision, allowing us to explore what’s hidden, to understand both the structure and function of our organs, and to help guide medical care.\n\nThink about it—when someone doesn’t feel well, when there’s discomfort or concern, what do we do? We turn to imaging. It becomes the eyes of the physician, revealing what’s happening beneath the surface. Through imaging, doctors can measure physiological function, detect disease, and ultimately provide treatment that can ease suffering or even save lives.\n\nThat’s the true power of medical imaging—and why we call it the inner vision of modern medicine.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Imagine being able to look at tissues, organs, even down to the cellular level. Sounds like science fiction, right?\n\nWell, that’s exactly the dream of medical imaging. This field gives us a kind of \"super vision\"—an inner vision—that lets us explore the human body from the inside out, completely noninvasively.\n\nAnd the truth is, what once seemed futuristic is now part of everyday medical practice. With the tools we’ll talk about in this course, clinicians can detect problems earlier, treat patients more precisely, and monitor progress more closely. Many of the advances in imaging came from the needs that once seemed impossible—until technology caught up.

In 1895, a German physicist named Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen was experimenting with cathode rays when he discovered something totally unexpected—an invisible form of radiation that could pass through solid objects. He called them X-rays because he didn’t quite know what they were.\n\nTo test his discovery, he took the first X-ray image—a picture of his wife’s hand. You could clearly see the bones, and even her wedding ring. It was the first time humans saw inside the body without surgery. That moment changed medicine forever.\n\nX-rays could depict dense structures like bones and metal with incredible clarity. This breakthrough was so significant that Roentgen received a Nobel Prize in 1901.\n\nThat single discovery launched the field of radiology—and over a century later, we’re still building on it.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

It’s fast, affordable, and incredibly useful.\n\nLet’s say someone falls and hurts their arm. An X-ray can quickly show whether there's a fracture. Or in breast cancer screening, mammography—a specialized type of X-ray radiography—can reveal tiny calcifications or early tumors that might not be detectable by touch. Early detection like this can save lives.\n\nBut there’s a limitation with X-ray radiographs. They’re 2D projections, so everything in the body along the X-ray path gets stacked into one image. That makes it hard to see soft tissues clearly or to isolate specific structures.\n\nSo, the next logical step was to ask—what if we could look from multiple directions and reconstruct a full 3D view of what’s inside? That question led to the development of Computed Tomography, or CT, which we’ll get into next.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

But there’s a catch—everything in that path gets layered on top of each other. It’s like looking at shadows overlapped together.\n\nNow imagine if we could take many X-ray radiographs around the body—virtually, of course—and figure out what’s happening on transverse sections. That’s exactly what computed tomography, or CT, allows us to do.\n\nThe word \"tomography\" comes from Greek—\"tomos\" means slice, and \"graphy\" means writing or drawing. So, we're basically drawing slices of the body. With CT, we collect X-ray projections from many angles, then use a computer to reconstruct a cross-sectional image.\n\nThe result? A crystal-clear view of internal anatomy, without overlapping tissues. Today’s CT scanners are incredibly precise—some can even resolve features smaller than a millimeter. Think of it like slicing a watermelon and looking inside but doing it without a knife—just scanning.

Some are great for structure, others for function. Some are good at seeing bones, others at detecting molecular processes like metabolism or gene expression.\n\nIn fact, no single technique gives us the whole picture. That’s why modern medicine often combines them—what we call multimodal imaging. When we link them together, we get a rather rich view of what’s going on inside the body.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

It’s a direct result of what the camera sees. But tomographic imaging is different. You don’t directly capture the image you want. Instead, you collect data from many different angles, and that data is a kind of indirect measurement—a projection of what's inside.\n\nNow here’s the key part: to get a cross-sectional image, we need to do something called inversion. In other words, we take the measurements and reverse-engineer the internal structure that produced them.\n\nThis is an inverse problem. It’s different from the more familiar forward problem, where you know all the inputs, and a forward model, and calculate the outcome. Like in physics: you know the force and the mass, so you calculate how something moves.\n\nIn tomography, it’s the opposite. You see the outcome—the measurement—and you ask: what could have caused this? That’s a lot harder.\n\nHere’s a fun analogy: think of boiling an egg. That’s a straightforward process. But what if someone gave you a boiled egg and said, “Unboil it”? That’s the inverse problem. Sounds impossible—but researchers have found ways to reverse that process under specific conditions. It’s challenging, but not hopeless. And that’s what makes inversion in imaging both difficult and exciting.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

What you get is not the true image, but a version that’s been blurred in several ways.\n\nNow, how do we describe that blurring? In image processing, we model it using something called a point spread function—or PSF for short. This describes how a single point of light spreads out in the image.\n\nThe process that causes blurring is called convolution. It’s a mathematical operation that combines the original image with the PSF. Convolution is sort of like multiplication—but in the so-called Fourier space that we will explain later in this course. Indeed, in the Fourier domain, convolution becomes regular multiplication. The Fourier transform is often performed using a fast algorithm, FFT in short. That simplifies a lot of computations.\n\nBut now comes the hard part: what if all you have is the blurry image? Can you work backward and recover the original, sharp version?\n\nThat’s another inverse problem. And just like with tomography, it’s tricky. You're trying to undo the effect of the blur, based on your knowledge of the system. It takes clever algorithms and good models—but it can be done. And that’s the kind of thinking we’ll develop throughout this course.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

These are the building blocks. But once you reach higher levels—like where we are now—those simple operations take on more advanced forms.\n\nTake addition, for example. At this level, we’re not just adding a few numbers—we might be summing over an infinite number of values. That’s what integration is: it's a continuous version of addition, used when we add up contributions from every point in a region.\n\nWhat about subtraction? In calculus, that becomes differentiation. Instead of just finding a difference between two numbers, we’re looking at how fast something is changing at an exact point by evaluating a very small difference of a smooth function between two rather close points.\n\nNow let’s look at multiplication. In imaging, we move from regular multiplication to something called convolution—a fundamental concept in systems and signal processing. Convolution helps us model how a spatially-invariant linear system modifies a signal or an image. You’ll see this again and again in medical imaging. Again, a convolution in a spatial or time domain is a multiplication in the Fourier domain.\n\nAnd finally, what about division? Here’s where things get interesting. The advanced version of division—where you’re trying to reverse a process—is what we call an inverse solution; the deblurring problem is a good example. You’re given a blurry image, and your job is to figure out what is the underlying ground truth image. And that’s essentially what we do in tomographic imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Much harder than the forward process.\n\nIn a forward problem, you start with all the information, and you calculate the outcome. That’s usually pretty straightforward. But an inverse problem is the opposite: you’re starting with the outcome, and trying to infer what caused it.\n\nAnd this is where things get tricky. There might be multiple possible answers, or the data might be noisy or incomplete. You need to bring in clever mathematics, algorithms, physical models, and prior knowledge to make sense of it all.\n\nThat’s why this course isn’t just about memorizing facts.

In the foundation phase—highlighted in light blue—you’ll build the critical background knowledge necessary to understand modern biomedical imaging systems. This includes essential concepts in linear systems, convolution, and Fourier analysis. These are the mathematical and conceptual tools at the heart of almost every imaging modality we’ll cover later.\n\nWhy this structure? Well, my previous experience with diverse students tells me that not everyone enters this course with the same preparation. Some of you may have strong backgrounds in physics, applied math, and electrical engineering—and that’s great. You might already be familiar with system theory and Fourier transform. But many others come from biology, chemistry, or material science backgrounds, where these topics are not emphasized. That’s completely okay.\n\nMedical imaging is interdisciplinary—and complex. So my job is to guide all of you, regardless of background, to the point where you understand these core ideas clearly and intuitively. It won't be enough to just listen and watch these lectures. You’ll need to invest time in previewing and reviewing the materials and doing the assignments. But rest assured—your effort will pay off. These foundational topics will resurface again and again, especially in modalities like CT and MRI, where the Fourier transform is a key player.\n\nAlso, linear systems might look simple on the surface—after all, they obey additivity and scaling rules—but they come with nuances. One particularly subtle concept is convolution, which plays a crucial role in both systems analysis and image reconstruction. We’ll make sure you understand not just how to compute it, but also why it matters and how it shows up in real-world scanners.\n\nSo, we begin with the foundation. Later, we’ll shift to the modality phase, shown in dark green—where we delve into imaging techniques like X-ray CT, nuclear imaging, MRI, ultrasound, and optical imaging. Each one has unique physics, engineering principles, and clinical applications.\n\nThink of it this way: the foundation is your universal imaging 'language'. Once you master it, learning each new modality becomes much easier, and far more meaningful.\n\nLet me walk you through our tentative timeline for the course—though as with any plan, we may make some adjustments along the way.\n\nThis lecture kicks off the course. In our next session, you’ll be introduced to MATLAB. If you're unfamiliar with it, don’t worry—our teaching assistant will help you get started. MATLAB is a vital tool in imaging research, especially when modeling systems or reconstructing images from tomographic data. After the introduction, you’ll have a short MATLAB-related assignment to sharpen your skills.\n\nThen we move into the foundation module—the light blue section. This is where we cover the theoretical concepts that apply across imaging technologies. After that, we transition to the green section—where we examine individual imaging modalities.\n\nYou’ll also be evaluated through three closed-book exams spaced across the course: one after the foundation module, one after the first set of modalities (CT and nuclear imaging), and one to cover everything else. Your final grade will be based on a combination of these exams, your homework, and participation.\n\nNow, this is an online course, so we’ve adapted all the content accordingly. Pre-recorded lectures, interactive demos, and exercises will all be made available. If you have questions, we encourage you to reach out via the discussion forum or email. Quick responses are part of our commitment to help you succeed.\n\nA quick tip: spend quality time understanding the Fourier transform early on. It’s a recurring theme. And if you’ve ever wondered why exponential functions like \n𝑒^𝑖𝜃 show up everywhere, this course will make that connection crystal clear. We’ll discuss how they lead to elegant mathematical representations and how these expressions play into image formation.\n\nFinally, one last point. This course is not just about passing exams—it’s about equipping you with a deep understanding that you can carry forward into research, engineering design, and healthcare work. Let’s work together and learn from each other.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Even though it was published a while ago, the fundamental principles it covers haven’t changed. Physics is timeless in that way. We’ll supplement the book with more recent findings, particularly in areas like deep learning for image reconstruction, low-dose imaging, and multi-modal fusion—advances that have significantly shaped the field over past several years.\n\nThe textbook will guide your learning, especially in the second part of the course.

It’s taught by Professor Brad Osgood, and the best part is that it is freely available online through Stanford’s SEE platform. You can access the full textbook there and watch high-quality lecture videos.\n\nNow, a quick word of caution: the Stanford course spans an entire semester. The book is over 400 pages long. Don’t feel overwhelmed. You absolutely do not need to cover all of it. Think of it as a reference companion to our course. In fact, for our purposes, reading even 80–100 pages from selected sections will be more than enough to reinforce your understanding.\n\nWhat makes this resource valuable is the clarity and consistency of its explanations and mathematical treatment. It builds the theory from the ground up, with elegant examples and a style that’s both rigorous and readable. If you ever find yourself puzzled by a concept I introduce—say, the derivation of the Fourier series, or the intuition behind convolution—this book can offer a second viewpoint. Sometimes, a slightly different presentation is all you need for clarity.\n\nHowever, please note that we will follow our own structured path in this course. For example, I introduce linear systems before Fourier transforms, because in imaging, systems thinking provides the conceptual grounding. The Stanford course takes the reverse order. Both are valid—but here, we start with linear systems to better prepare for their applications in imaging modalities like CT and MRI.\n\nPlease use this Stanford material as a valuable supplement, not a replacement. You’ll benefit most by following our course flow carefully and referring to the Stanford book only when you want to go deeper or review challenging topics.\n\nLastly, although I have reached out for formal permission, the material seems publicly accessible and openly shared for educational use.

Essentially, the X-rays pass through the object, and what we measure is the energy of penetrated x-ray photons and then compute the line integral along the x-ray path. Such line integrals together form the Radon transform. To make it simpler, imagine you have an object, and you put all line integrals from a specific direction to form an x-ray projection. This projection is a one-dimensional profile, which is the information you can get along all the X-ray paths passing through the object in that direction.\n\nNow, let’s take this idea into the realm of mathematics. We start with a 2D image, denoted as \nf(x,y). When we have all x-ray projections or the Radon transform, we get a new 2D function  p(θ,t), where  t is the coordinate along the 1D detector array and  θ is the projection orientation. By changing the angle θ, we rotate the data acquisition system to gather x-ray projections.\n\nNow, the magic happens when we flip the process around. Given this collected projection dataset, our goal is to reconstruct the original 2D image f(x,y). This is the inverse process, and here’s where things get interesting: by perform the 1D Fourier trans of each and every of the 1D projections, we move into the Fourier domain.\n\nTo put it simply, the 1D projections we collect represent profiles in the frequency domain. By rotating the data acquisition system, we eventually capture the entire Fourier space. And once we have all the data in the Fourier space, we can apply the inverse Fourier transform to reconstruct the original image. This process connects the data from the physical object to the Fourier spectrum of the underlying image, and from the Fourier spectrum, we can reconstruct the original image.\n\nWhile this overview gives you the fundamental idea, later in the course, we’ll dive deeper into the Fourier transform, why they can be inverted, and how this mathematical framework ties directly to the imaging process. But for now, keep in mind that the forward process (how we collect data) and the inverse process (how we reconstruct the image) are two sides of the same coin, closely linked by Fourier analysis.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

While the previous imaging techniques focused on capturing the anatomical structure, PET offers a powerful way to visualize the functional activity in the human body.\n\nSo, how does it work? Well, the key to PET is the introduction of radioactive tracers into the body. These tracers are typically radioactive chemicals that participate in your body’s metabolic processes. For example, tumors tend to consume a lot of glucose. If we couple glucose molecules with a radioactive tracer, we can track how much glucose the tumor is using, which directly correlates with its activity. Tumors, which are often highly metabolic, will naturally absorb more of this tracer.\n\nOnce the PET tracer is in the body, it begins to emit gamma ray photons in pairs, and two photons in a pair will travel in opposite directions. Gamma rays, much like X-rays, can penetrate through tissues and be detected externally. When we receive gamma ray photons from two different detector locations, we know they originated from the same event somewhere on the line connecting the two detectors.\nThis process is similar to the measurement of line integrals used for CT. Then, we can apply Fourier analysis to reconstruct the images. In PET, Fourier transforms help us create detailed, functional images of the body’s processes. The goal here is to understand how much activities are happening at specific locations. So, while we’ve seen how CT gives us anatomical details, PET allows us to observe the biological functions—like metabolism—within those structures.\n\nThis modality is especially useful for identifying cancerous tissues, studying brain function, and even monitoring heart conditions. Later, we’ll explain how the gamma ray photons are detected and processed to reconstruct these functional images. But for now, remember that PET imaging provides us with a way to look inside the body not just for its structure, but also for how physiology is actively working.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

While Positron Emission Tomography (PET) relies on the detection of paired gamma ray photons emitted from the tracer, SPECT works differently.\n\nIn SPECT, the radio tracer emits gamma ray photons randomly and individually, without being paired. Essentially, instead of detecting two photons coming from opposite directions (as we do in PET), we measure single gamma ray photons emitted from a radioactive tracer within the body.\n\nWhen a photon is detected through a collimator, we know it came from a particular path through the patient body, but since the photons are not paired, we need to use different data preprocessing and image reconstruction methods. SPECT provides valuable information, but it’s a bit different from PET. In SPECT, we capture these single photons from various angles around the body and use dedicated tomographic reconstruction techniques to create an image.\n\nWe’ll discuss the details of SPECT imaging later in the course, but for now, keep in mind that while PET relies on paired photons to provide highly precise spatial information, SPECT uses single photons to gather functional information in a different way. Both PET and SPECT produce tomographic images of radio-tracer activities.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

MRI uses a completely different approach compared to X-ray and nuclear imaging techniques including PET and SPECT. In MRI, we utilize radio frequency signals to gather detailed images of the body.\n\nHere’s how it works: First, we subject the patient to a very strong magnetic field. This magnetic field aligns the hydrogen nuclei—which are abundant in water molecules in your body. Then, we introduce a radio frequency (RF) signal that briefly disrupts this alignment, causing the hydrogen nuclei to emit their own radio frequency signals as they return to their original stable state.\n\nThe key advantage of MRI is that it is sensitive to the water content in different tissues and interactions of hydrogen nuclei with their micro-environments, which makes MRI extremely useful for imaging soft tissues like the brain, muscles, and organs. The signal we collect can give us a lot of valuable information, such as chemical shifts in tissues, which help us distinguish between different types of tissues and even detect abnormalities like tumors or inflammation.\n\nMRI is also great for studying brain activity, as the technique can be used to observe changes in blood flow over time. This makes MRI not only a structural imaging tool but also a functional one, adding a layer of depth to our understanding of the body.\n\nTogether with CT and nuclear imaging techniques, MRI forms the trio of most important imaging modalities. While CT focuses on capturing detailed anatomical structures using X-rays, and nuclear imaging provides insight into physiological functions, MRI offers unmatched soft tissue contrast and the ability to examine both structure and function in a non-invasive way, even into our thinking processes.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

While it might not be as widely discussed or as advanced as the big three—CT, nuclear imaging, and MRI—ultrasound remains a powerful, affordable, and safe imaging tool in medical practice, and seems playing an increasingly important role for point of care imaging.\n\nSo, how does ultrasound work? It operates based on the principle of mechanical vibrations. In ultrasound imaging, we use a device called a transducer, which contains piezoelectric materials. These materials can generate high-frequency sound waves when subjected to an electric current. These sound waves are then sent into the body.\n\nAs the sound waves travel through tissues, they interact with various structures inside the body. Some waves are reflected, and others continue through the tissues. The reflected waves are detected by the transducer, and from this data, we can reconstruct an image of the internal structures. Essentially, we’re mapping the body’s anatomy based on how sound waves bounce off tissues.\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of ultrasound is that it’s non-invasive and completely safe—unlike X-rays or CT scans, ultrasound doesn't involve ionizing radiation. It’s also incredibly cost-effective and high-speed, which makes it a go-to tool for many real-time imaging tasks. You’ll often see it used during fetal imaging in pregnancy, as well as in blood flow monitoring and guiding biopsies.\n\nWhile it may not provide the same level of detail as MRI or CT, ultrasound’s affordability, speed, and safety make it a valuable tool for many clinical applications.

Unlike the other imaging techniques we've discussed, optical imaging focuses on how light interacts with cells, allowing us to reveal molecular and cellular interactions in the body.\n\nOne unique aspect of optical imaging is its ability to extract signatures from these biological interactions, providing valuable information about what’s happening at a microscopic level. This is where things get exciting! For example, we can use luminescence probes to tag specific proteins or gene expressions. Once tagged, these proteins will emit a luminescent light and make them visible to our imaging system.\n\nThink of it like the glow of a firefly in a summer night. When certain proteins or cells are tagged, they emit bioluminescent light, which we can detect. This is a form of passive imaging, meaning the light we need to detect is emitted by the body itself, rather than steered by any external light source.\n\nFor example, in a typical experiment, an animal might be placed in a dark room, and we would observe the light emissions coming from specific areas on its body. We want to perform tomographic reconstruction to find the internal distribution of the bioluminescent sources. For that purpose, we combine an optical imager with a separate tomographic scanner, which helps us get both the anatomy and the optical properties of organs and structures to build a forward imaging model. After that, we can invert this forward model for reconstruction of a 3D distribution of bioluminescent sources.\n\nThe real challenge in optical imaging isn’t in the forward process—where we predict the external signal based on the known internal structures. The difficulty is in the inverse process, where we have this inverse problem: Given the external light signals we measure, how do we reconstruct the distribution of bioluminescent sources inside the body?\n\nTo do this, we use multiple mirrors to collect all the emitted light, creating a complete set of external views. We then use this data to reconstruct the internal light source distribution. This method has been known as bioluminescence tomography that we pioneered and has become quite popular in the literature.\n\nNote that optical imaging includes a good number of techniques.  Bioluminescence tomography is only one of them. We have fluorescence tomography as well, with fluorescence probes excitable by an external laser source. More clinically important is optical coherence tomography or OCT, which is used to check your retina in eye clinic.\n\nIn summary, optical imaging, like other modalities, allows us to visualize and understand structures, probes or tracers inside the body. It’s a unique and powerful way to study biology from the inside out.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Once you have an image, you don’t just look at it—you analyze it to gain task-specific information. This is where the domain of image processing grows.\n\nIn medicine, image analysis is crucial for extracting actionable insights. There are various techniques we use, such as image segmentation, where we identify specific regions or structures within the image—like tumors, organs, or blood vessels. By doing this, we can focus on areas of interest, making it easier to understand what’s happening inside the body.\n\nAnother important tool is image classification, which allows us to categorize different structures or tissues based on their visual features. This helps doctors make diagnosis, track changes over time, or even guide interventional procedures. \n\nWe also use techniques like image enhancement, which improves the quality of the image by making certain features more visible, such as image deblurring, which sharpens images that might have been blurry due to motion or technical issues.\n\nSome textbooks on medical imaging even include image visualization. This is where new technologies like augmented reality (AR) become relevant. I recently read an article, where the use of AR is discussed for medical imaging-guided surgery. With this innovative method, surgeons wear specialized glasses that overlay imaging data directly onto the patient’s body during surgery, guiding their actions in real time. While this is an exciting application of medical imaging, for the scope of this course, we’ll focus more on bio-imaging and bio-instrumentation, with an emphasis on tomographic imaging.\n\nIn this course, we’ll briefly cover some key aspects of image analysis, but we won’t delve too deeply into every aspect of processing.

In understanding the human body, we often talk about two key concepts: phenotype and genotype.\n\nGenotype refers to your genetic makeup—the DNA that gives rise to your traits. Meanwhile, phenotype refers to the observable characteristics of an individual, such as physical traits, biological functions, and disease states. Biomedical imaging plays a crucial role in studying the phenotype. Through imaging, we can visualize and analyze the biological structures and functions that define an individual’s phenotype.\n\nNow, bioinformatics and genetic profiling give us a lot of information about the genotype—things like your genetic predispositions and variations. However, these genetic insights need to be connected to the physical manifestation of the genes—the phenotype. We can use biomedical imaging to observe and understand the effects of genetic factors on the body.\n\nWhile we’re entering the world of imaging in this course, it’s important to recognize that we’re focusing primarily on phenotype—how imaging allows us to visualize and analyze the body's structures and functions. However, linking genotype (your genetic information) with phenotype (the observable traits and conditions) is an essential goal for personalized medicine.

For students who choose this option, 30% of your grade could come from the research project, with 70% from other course elements. Many students find that they don’t have the time to take such a project, but if you’re passionate about it, the opportunity is there. In fact, some of my former students, even high school students, have worked with me on research projects, and have gone on to get their work published in conferences and journals, which can be a huge boost to their career.\n\nSo, if you feel like the course is a bit easy and you’re ready to go beyond, this project option could be a perfect fit. The office door is always open, and if you choose this path, you'll get real-world experience and potentially contribute to cutting-edge research.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

As artificial intelligence continues to advance, we’re already seeing systems that can match or even surpass human performance in interpreting medical images. It’s very possible that, in the not-so-distant future, many of the tasks traditionally done by radiologists will be basically handled by AI.\n\nAnd it goes beyond that. Imagine robotic surgeons, guided by multimodal imaging and machine learning, performing procedures with precision that’s hard for even the best human surgeon to match. Over time, we might see AI and robotics take on more and more roles in healthcare, not to replace professionals, but to enhance what we can achieve—and to make healthcare safer, faster, and more accessible.\n\nThis is the direction the field is moving in, and it’s one of the reasons why understanding imaging technologies today is so valuable and timely.

A function is a mathematical rule that maps each input from one set, called the domain, to an output in another set, called the range. Systems work in a similar way. They take an input, process it through interconnected elements, and produce an output.\nThese elements could represent anything: parts of a social system, components of a physiological system, or pieces of a mechanical system. The important point is that both functions and systems describe relationships between inputs and outputs. Our goal is to define these relationships clearly so that we can apply them to engineering and medical imaging problems.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 40}

We use mathematical operators—like L or O—to describe how a system transforms an input into an output. If you feed an input signal, V, into a system, the output, W, represents how that signal is modified.\nThese inputs and outputs can take many forms: time-dependent signals, images, tensors, or even discrete data sets like color values in an image. The concept is general: a system processes an input and produces an output, just as a function maps domain to range.\nIn medical imaging, we apply this thinking to devices like CT scanners, where the entire system transforms physical signals into diagnostic images.

Without measurement, we can’t really understand or control anything. In fact, measurement is at the heart of both engineering and physics. For example, in quantum mechanics, measurement plays a critical role—until we measure, we don’t truly know a system’s state. It’s like the famous thought experiment with Schrödinger’s cat: is the cat alive or dead? Only measurement collapses the uncertainty into reality.\nWhen we perform measurements, we typically have input variables and sometimes a reference. Consider weighing an object: we place a known weight on one side of a balance and the object on the other. If the balance is level, we know the object’s weight equals the standard. Similarly, in electrical measurements, we might compare an unknown resistance or voltage against a reference using an ohmmeter or a multimeter. These devices let us measure things like current, resistance, and capacitance with precision.\nMore broadly, think of an instructor as a system: when the calendar says it’s time for class, that’s the input.

A high-quality system will produce sharp, high-contrast images, while a less precise system might blur details, much like how a low-resolution camera produces softer, less defined pictures.

The square root function doesn’t satisfy either—if you take two inputs and sum their square roots, that doesn’t equal the square root of the sum, and scaling the input doesn’t scale the output proportionally.\nOn the other hand, consider a linear transformation in three-dimensional space, like multiplying a vector by a 3×3 matrix.

As the window becomes infinitesimally small, that point converges exactly to t naught.\nSo what do we get?\n\nThe integral from minus infinity to infinity of delta of t minus t naught, times f of t, d t — equals f of t naught.\nThis is called the sampling property of the delta function. It’s as if the delta function \"reaches into\" the function and pulls out the value at a single point.\nEven more fascinating — we can actually rebuild any continuous function using this idea. By stacking many delta functions across time, each weighted by the function’s value at that point, we can reconstruct the entire function. Think of it like slicing the function into tiny pieces — each slice tells us something, and when you add them all together, you get the full picture again.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 49}

That is, we take the delta function, shift it to the appropriate position, and scale it by the function’s value at that point. When we add all these together, we recover the original function.\nHere you can see the mathematical expression in this slide.\n\nThis formula tells us that each sample of g contributes one impulse, located at n equals k, and scaled by g at that k. When we add up all these scaled and shifted impulses, we rebuild the function g.\n\nLet’s look at a specific example to make this concrete.\n\nSuppose your discrete function consists of just a few nonzero points. The first point is at n equals 0 with value 1 — that’s just delta of n.\n\u000bThe second point is at n equals 1 with a value of negative 1 — so we write that as minus delta of n minus 1.\n\u000bAnd the third point is at n equals 2 with a value of 1.5 — which becomes 1.5 times delta of n minus 2.\n\nBy adding these three impulses together, we effectively reconstruct the original signal, point by point.\n\nThis approach is not only elegant, it’s also foundational in signal processing and linear systems.

Because once you can visualize what’s going on, everything becomes more intuitive. You not only understand the formulas better, but you also remember them more easily.

The inner product is calculated by pairing each element of vector A with the corresponding element of vector B, multiplying those pairs, and then summing the results.\n\nIn mathematical terms, if vector A has components A1 through An, and vector B has components B1 through Bn, then the inner product of A and B is the sum from i equals 1 to n of Ai times Bi.\n\nLet’s look at an example. Take vector A as 1, 3, negative 5, and vector B as 4, negative 2, negative 1.\n\nWe compute the inner product as follows:\u000bOne times four, plus\u000bthree times negative two, plus\u000bnegative five times negative one.\nThat gives us 4 minus 6 plus 5, which equals 3.\n\nNow, why is this important? Because when we perform convolution or cross-correlation, we are essentially performing inner products — over and over again. Each time we slide one signal over another and compute the inner product, we generate one output value.\nThis is exactly how matched filtering works in radar systems. When an incoming signal — such as an echo from an aircraft — aligns with a known pattern, the inner product reaches its peak, making it possible to detect the target.\n\nFrom the perspective of linear systems, cross-correlation involves flipping and shifting one signal, and then computing a whole series of inner products. The result becomes the output response of a shift-invariant system. So understanding inner products is not just helpful — it’s essential.\n\nThere’s also a beautiful geometric interpretation. The inner product of two vectors equals the product of their magnitudes multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them.\n\nIn other words, the dot product of A and B equals the norm of A times the norm of B times cosine theta — where theta is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nSo, if the vectors point in the same direction, the angle is zero, and cosine of zero is one — giving you the maximum value.\nIf the vectors are orthogonal — that is, they are at 90 degrees — then cosine theta is zero, and so is the inner product.\n\nAnd here’s something really elegant: if you take the inner product of a vector with itself, you get the square of its length. That means the magnitude of a vector can be defined as the square root of its inner product with itself.\n\nIn summary, the inner product captures three things at once — length, angle, and alignment — all in a single operation. And that makes it the foundation for everything we’ll do with Fourier series.\n\nHere’s another way to think about it — by drawing a biological analogy.\n\nThink of the inner product like the base pairing in DNA. Just as DNA sequences are built from matched pairs of bases — adenine with thymine, guanine with cytosine — our inner product is built by matching one element from vector A with one from vector B. Each matched pair contributes to the total result.\nAnd just like those base pairings carry the essential instructions for life, this mathematical pairing carries the structural foundation for data analysis. The overall sum of those matched pairs — the inner product — gives us meaningful information about the relationship between two datasets or signals.\n\nIn many ways, you can think of the inner product as the DNA of data science. It’s what lets us quantify similarity, compute distances, analyze angles, and perform transformations. We’ll keep coming back to this idea throughout the course, so keep it in mind as we go deeper into Fourier theory.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Along with the zero vector — that’s the origin — these two define a straight line. This line contains all the scalar multiples of vector B. In other words, the line L of k equals k times vector B, where k is any real number.\n\nNow here’s the key idea: we want to project vector A onto that line.

That’s essentially the Euclidean distance, squared — but applied component-wise in vector form.\n\nThis is an extension of the classic distance formula you saw in high school geometry: the square root of x one minus x two squared, plus y one minus y two squared. But now, we’re doing it in higher dimensions.\n\nTo minimize the distance, we take the derivative of that squared distance with respect to k, set it to zero, and solve for k. When we do that, we arrive at this important formula:\nk equals the inner product of vector A and vector B, divided by the squared norm of vector B.\u000b\nThat gives us the scaling factor for the projection.\u000bAnd then, the distance from the origin to the projected point is:\nD equals A dot B, divided by the norm of B.\n\u000bThis leads us back to a central identity in geometry:\nA dot B equals the length of A times the length of B times the cosine of theta, where theta is the angle between the two vectors.\nSo what does this all mean geometrically?\n\nThe inner product tells us how much of vector A lies in the direction of vector B.\u000bIt’s the projection of A onto B, scaled by how aligned the two are — and that alignment is captured by the cosine of the angle.\nIf A and B are orthogonal — that means they’re at a ninety-degree angle — then the cosine is zero, and so is the inner product.\u000bBut if they point in the same direction, the cosine is one, and the projection is at its maximum.\n\nSo this isn’t just an abstract formula. It gives us a powerful visual interpretation of what the inner product is really doing — measuring alignment.\nAnd this interpretation extends naturally into higher dimensions, which makes it especially useful as we transition into Fourier series.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

It’s not just a theoretical result — it’s a tool that offers deep insight into how vectors relate to each other.\n\nNow, the inequality is written here in both summation and vector form.\nYou can see here.\n\nIn vector form, we write:\u000bThe absolute value of a dot b is less than or equal to the norm of a times the norm of b.\n\nIn plain terms, if you take the dot product of two vectors, its value will always be smaller than or equal to the product of their magnitudes.\n\u000bEquality holds only when one vector is a scalar multiple of the other — in other words, when the vectors are perfectly aligned.\n\nTo make this more concrete, let’s consider the two-dimensional version:\u000bThe quantity a squared plus b squared, multiplied by c squared plus d squared, is greater than or equal to the square of a times c plus b times d.\n\nThis is a specific case of the inequality and shows how it works with actual vector components.\nNow, how do we prove it?\n\nA typical approach involves setting up a quadratic expression that includes both vectors and a variable, x.\u000bWe write the sum over i of the square of the quantity aᵢ times x plus bᵢ.\u000bThis can also be written as the sum of aᵢ squared, multiplied by the square of x plus bᵢ divided by aᵢ\u000b\nWe set this whole expression equal to zero and solve the resulting quadratic equation.\nThis works because the square of a real quantity is always non-negative, so the sum equals zero only when all terms vanish.\u000bThat only happens when the vectors are linearly dependent — and that’s what gives us the equality condition.\nNow, let’s connect this back to geometry. Remember from the last slide, the inner product of two vectors equals the product of their magnitudes times the cosine of the angle between them.\n\u000bThat is:\u000bA dot B equals the norm of A times the norm of B times cosine theta.\nSince cosine of theta is always between negative one and one, the dot product can never exceed the product of the magnitudes.\u000bThat’s the geometric heart of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.\n\nSo this isn’t just an algebraic result — it’s a powerful guarantee about how closely two vectors can align.\nAnd as we move into Fourier analysis, this principle plays a crucial role in how we represent signals, enforce orthogonality, and ensure numerical stability.\nSo keep this inequality in mind — we’ll revisit it again when we start working with basis functions and Fourier coefficients.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Now, let’s visualize what it really means. \n\nImagine two vectors, A and B, drawn as arrows in space. The inner product between them — also called the dot product — can be expressed as:\n\u000bA dot B equals norm of A times norm of B times cosine of the angle theta between them.\nNow, keep in mind: cosine theta is always between minus one and plus one. So unless theta is exactly zero degrees — which means the vectors are pointing in the exact same direction — the inner product is always strictly less than the product of the magnitudes. That’s why the inequality holds.\nBut what about equality? \n\nWell, equality happens when cosine theta is equal to one. In other words, when theta equals zero. Geometrically, that means vector A lies perfectly along the line defined by vector B. One vector is simply a scaled version of the other.\n\nIn mathematical terms, we say:\u000bbi divided by ai equals c, for all values of i.\n\u000bThis means each component of B is a constant multiple of the corresponding component of A.\nThat constant, c, tells us how much we stretch or shrink vector A to get to vector B. When that relationship holds for every component, the two vectors are not only aligned — they are perfectly aligned, differing only in length.\nThis concept is extremely useful in signal processing. Take matched filtering, for example. Imagine you transmit a radar pulse. That pulse travels, reflects off an object — say, an airplane — and comes back. Because of factors like distance or material type, the return signal may be delayed or weakened, but its shape stays the same.\n\nSo how do we detect it?\nWe use cross-correlation. That means we slide the known signal over the incoming data and measure how similar they are. When the alignment is strongest — that is, when the cross-correlation reaches its peak — the two signals are most similar in shape.\nThis is where the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality comes in. When two signals align perfectly, their inner product is maximized. Cosine theta approaches one. That tells us: these vectors — or signals — are almost perfectly matched.\n\nSo this triangle diagram isn't just a piece of geometry. It’s a powerful mental image that shows how the inner product captures alignment. And equality — the case when the inequality becomes an equality — only happens when vectors point exactly in the same direction. Whether you're in two dimensions, three dimensions, or even much higher-dimensional space — the story remains the same.\nThat’s the geometric heart of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

It’s grounded in both geometric intuition and practical applications — including signal detection and system analysis. But geometrically, it gives us the clearest picture of how vectors interact.\nFor example, if we take the inner product of a vector with itself, we get: v dot v equals the sum of the squares of its components. That is: v1 squared plus v2 squared, and so on, up to vn squared. Which is simply the squared length of the vector — or the norm squared. \n\nSo we write: v dot v equals double bar v double bar squared.\nThis gives us the magnitude of a vector, which is fundamental to defining distance, angle, and orthogonality — even in very high-dimensional spaces.\nNow, let’s talk about basis.\u000bIn R-n, we use what’s called the natural basis. These are vectors of length one that point along each coordinate direction.\u000bSo we define:\u000be1 as 1, 0, 0, and so on,\u000be2 as 0, 1, 0, and so on,\u000band so on, up to en, which is 0, 0, and finally 1.\n\nEach of these vectors is orthogonal to the others, meaning their inner product is zero unless you're comparing a vector with itself.\nSo any vector v can be written as a linear combination of these basis vectors.

Cosine is an even function. That means if you reflect it across the vertical axis — the y-axis — it stays the same. In other words, the cosine of negative x equals the cosine of x.\n\nSine, on the other hand, is an odd function. That means it’s symmetric about the origin. So the sine of negative x equals the negative sine of x.\nBut here’s something subtle. Whether a function is “even” or “odd” actually depends on where you place the origin. If you shift your coordinate system, the symmetry can change. So this classification is based on our point of view — not an absolute property of the function.\n\nNow here’s the deeper idea: sine and cosine functions together form an orthogonal basis. That means you can use them to represent any reasonable function — just like we previously used delta functions or unit vectors.\nThis sets the stage for a powerful idea: instead of expressing a function as a sum of impulses, like a series of spikes, we can express it as a sum of waves — smooth, continuous, sinusoidal components.\nAnd that’s exactly what we’ll explore next through the lens of the Fourier series.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

It tells us that any reasonable function — smooth or sharp — can be represented as a weighted sum of sine and cosine waves. These sinusoidal components differ in frequency, phase, and amplitude.

We can even mimic sharp edges or jumps, like you see in square waves, just by stacking enough high-frequency components together.\nHere’s what’s important: each sine or cosine wave contributes a specific amount to the final signal. That amount is determined by its amplitude.

Frequencies closer to the center are low — representing broad, smooth changes.

Depending on how you observe them, they might act like tiny particles... or spread out like waves.\nInterestingly, we see a similar duality in information science.\n\nOn one side, we have the particle view: information as discrete units — like pixels in an image, impulses in a signal, or delta functions in a mathematical model. This is the pixel-by-pixel, sample-by-sample perspective. It's granular and local.\nOn the other side, we have the wave view: information described in terms of global, smooth, continuous oscillations — sinusoidal waves of varying frequency, amplitude, and phase. This perspective captures structure across space or time — the big picture.\n\nSo when we represent a function — or an image, or a signal — we can choose either perspective.\nUsing delta functions or impulses, we build the signal by assembling localized pieces — one sharp component at a time.\nUsing sinusoidal functions, we build it using smooth, periodic waveforms that span the domain.\nBoth approaches are valid. In fact, they are mathematically equivalent when used with the right basis. \nAnd this is the central idea of today’s lecture:\u000b\nA function can be viewed as a vector in a high-dimensional space — and depending on our basis, we can represent that function in many different ways.\nYou can think of a delta basis: where each basis function is an impulse at a specific location.\nOr a sinusoidal basis: where each basis function is a sine or cosine wave with a different frequency.\nThese are just two different coordinate systems for the same space — and by projecting the function onto the basis elements, we retrieve coefficients that let us reconstruct the original signal as a linear combination.\n\nSo in summary:\u000bThe delta basis gives us a particle-like view.\u000bThe sinusoidal basis gives us a wave-like view.\u000bAnd both help us understand information from complementary perspectives.\n\nThis concludes the first part of our discussion — building intuition through geometry and representation.\nIn the second half, we’ll go deeper into Fourier series, where we work with periodic functions, and learn how to express them precisely in terms of sine and cosine components.

Formally, we say that a function f of x is periodic if there exists a value — which we call the period, and usually denote with capital P — such that:\nf of x plus P equals f of x, for all values of x.\nThis repeating behavior is what allows us to use the Fourier series to represent such functions.\nTake a look at the top plot in this slide. It shows a one-dimensional example of a periodic function. It doesn't need to be a perfect sine or cosine wave — the key idea is that it repeats exactly after a fixed horizontal interval. In this case, that interval is P units.\n\nNow look at the image below it. That’s a real-world example — a two-dimensional periodic pattern. Patterns like this are common in materials science, digital imaging, or even textures. You can see how the structure repeats itself in both the horizontal and vertical directions — that’s spatial periodicity in two dimensions.\nSo what is our goal?\n\nWe want to understand how any periodic function — no matter how smooth, jagged, or irregular — can be represented as a sum of sine and cosine waves.\nThis is the heart of the Fourier series. Even if a function looks complicated, we can rebuild it precisely by combining a collection of smooth sinusoidal waves — each with its own frequency, amplitude, and phase.\n\nAnd here’s the beautiful part:\u000bIf we get just one period of the function right, the rest of the function falls into place, because it's simply repetition.\nSo moving forward, we’ll first focus on periodic functions in one dimension. We’ll go through the math, develop the intuition, and build the full Fourier series representation. Then, once we understand that, we’ll extend the same ideas to two-dimensional cases, and even three dimensions — which is especially useful for signals, images, and medical data.\nLet’s now dive into the mathematics and see how it all comes together.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

We call this the unit period. The key assumption here is that the function repeats every unit interval. So if we understand what the function does between 0 and 1, we automatically understand it from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and even from negative 1 to 0.\n\nLater, we’ll generalize to other periods — like from 0 to capital T, or from negative T over 2 to positive T over 2. But for now, let’s build our intuition using this simpler interval.\n\nSo, what kinds of functions are we considering here?\nWe’re working with real-valued functions that are square-integrable — that means when you square the function and integrate it over the interval from 0 to 1, the result is finite. If that integral blows up to infinity, the function is too wild, and we can’t represent it with a Fourier series. But if it’s finite, then the function behaves well enough for our purposes.\n\nMathematically, we say such functions belong to the space L square of zero to one — that’s the set of square-integrable functions over the interval from 0 to 1. This is a Hilbert space, meaning we can treat functions like vectors in an infinite-dimensional space.\nAnd just like vectors have a basis, functions in this space also have an orthonormal basis.\nWhat does that basis look like?\n\nIt turns out the basis consists of the constant function 1, plus an infinite family of sine and cosine functions:\nSquare root of 2 times cosine of 2 pi n t\nSquare root of 2 times sine of 2 pi n t\u000bfor n equals 1, 2, 3, and so on.\nThe factor of square root 2 ensures that each function has unit length — meaning, its inner product with itself equals 1. That’s what makes the basis orthonormal.\n\nSo here’s the big idea:\nAny square-integrable function over the interval 0 to 1 can be expressed as a sum of these basis functions.\u000bAnd this sum is called the Fourier series.\nMathematically, we write:\nf of t equals a naught over two,\u000bplus the summation over n of a n times cosine of 2 pi n t,\u000bplus the summation over n of b n times sine of 2 pi n t.\n\nSo, what do all these parts mean?\nFirst, a naught is called the DC component. It represents the average value of the function over one period.\nThe a n coefficients are multiplied by cosine terms. These describe the even, symmetric parts of the function.\nAnd the b n coefficients go with the sine terms. They capture the odd, asymmetric parts of the function.\nIn essence, what we’re doing is splitting the function into symmetrical and asymmetrical patterns, using sines and cosines as building blocks. This is what makes the Fourier series so elegant — it expresses any periodic function as a mix of smooth, familiar waveforms.\n\nNow, each of these coefficients can be computed using inner products, which we'll define using integrals in the next slide.\nBut conceptually, this is just like decomposing a vector into components — except now we're working with continuous functions in an infinite-dimensional space, using smooth sine and cosine waves as our basis.\nAnd that’s the beauty of the Fourier series:\u000bRather than reconstructing a function using spikes or samples, we rebuild it by layering together simple waveforms.\nThis is the core principle of Fourier analysis:\u000bBreak down the complex using the simple.\u000bUse a family of smooth waves to represent arbitrary structure.\nNext, let’s see how to actually compute those coefficients.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

But if we break it down, it’s very intuitive.\nIn the world of regular vectors — say, in two or three dimensions — we say vectors are orthogonal if they’re at right angles to each other. And if each one also has a length of one, we call them orthonormal.\nThe same idea applies in function space. But instead of using a dot product like we do for regular vectors, we use something called an inner product — which is defined using an integral. This inner product helps us measure both length and angle between functions.\n\nLet’s walk through the specific relationships shown here.\nFirst, the constant function — just the number one — has unit length. That means if we take its inner product with itself, we get one. So it’s normalized.\nNow let’s see what happens when we compare the constant function with a cosine or a sine function. If we take the inner product of the constant with cosine of two pi times n times t, we get zero — for any positive integer n. The same is true for sine.\n\nWhy does this happen? Well, cosine and sine both oscillate above and below the horizontal axis, and over a full cycle, the positive and negative areas cancel out. So when you compare either of them with the constant, the result is zero — meaning they’re orthogonal.\n\nNext, let’s compare sine and cosine functions with each other. Say, cosine of two pi times m times t and sine of two pi times n times t. Regardless of which frequencies m and n we choose, their inner product is zero. So sine and cosine are always orthogonal to each other.\n\nNow here’s where it gets a bit more subtle.\nIf we compare cosine functions with other cosine functions — or sine with sine — the result depends on the frequencies.\nIf the frequencies are different, meaning m is not equal to n, the inner product is zero. They’re orthogonal.\nBut if the frequencies match — so m equals n — the inner product is one-half. That means the functions are not quite unit-length yet. They’re orthogonal but not normalized.\n\nTo fix that, we just scale the sine and cosine functions by the square root of two. Then, their inner product with themselves becomes exactly one, making the whole set orthonormal.\nSo here’s the big picture: we now have a set of functions — the constant, sine waves, and cosine waves — that are all mutually perpendicular and have unit length. Together, they form a complete orthonormal basis.\n\nAnd once we have this basis, we can represent any periodic function as a combination of these building blocks. That combination is what we call the Fourier series, and the weights we use — the Fourier coefficients — tell us how much of each wave is present in the function.\nNext, we’ll explore how to actually compute those coefficients using integrals.\nLet’s keep going.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

In the context of Fourier series, harmonics refer to these beautifully smooth sinusoidal components, each oscillating at a different frequency.\nLet’s unpack that.\n\nThe red curve you see here is the first harmonic, or the fundamental frequency. It completes exactly one full oscillation over the interval from 0 to 1. This is what we call the n equals 1 term in the Fourier series.\nNow move down to the blue curve — that’s the second harmonic, where n equals 2. It oscillates twice as fast — so you get two full cycles in the same interval.\nThen the green one, with n equals 3, completes three full oscillations, and so on. As you move further down the harmonic ladder — to n equals 4, n equal 5, and beyond — the frequency keeps increasing, and the wave becomes more and more tightly packed.\n\nThis is the key idea behind the Fourier series: you build complex functions using simple, smooth building blocks. And those blocks are just sine and cosine waves with integer frequencies.\nHere’s something subtle but very important: look at how all these harmonic components start and end at the same value — specifically, at zero. Not only that, but their rate of change — or slope — at the beginning and end is also smoothly matched. That’s what allows them to blend so seamlessly when we stack them.\n\nWhy does this matter?\nBecause when you’re representing a periodic function, you want the end of one period to flow naturally into the start of the next. If there’s a mismatch — either in value or in slope — you get a jump, or a kink, which breaks the smoothness of the function. The harmonics are special because they ensure everything lines up perfectly — not just in position, but in motion.\n\nThat’s why we call these functions harmonic. They don’t just oscillate — they cooperate. And together, they can mimic anything from a square wave to the shape of a human voice, as long as you choose the right amplitudes and phases.\nThis is the genius of Fourier’s insight: no matter how jagged or irregular a periodic signal may appear, you can always think of it as being composed of pure tones — harmonics — each contributing its rhythm to the total pattern.\nAlright, now that we've built some intuition about harmonics, let's move on to the mathematical tools that allow us to compute their coefficients precisely.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

It’s constant — it doesn’t vary or oscillate. You can think of it as the baseline level. For example, in an image, this might represent the overall brightness. In audio, it could be the steady background hum.\n\nThen we have the even parts — these are built using cosine waves.\u000bEach term looks like “a n times cosine of two pi n t,” where n is a positive integer: one, two, three, and so on.\u000bCosine is symmetric — if you flip it left to right, it looks exactly the same. That’s why we call these even components — they preserve that mirror-like symmetry.\nNext come the odd parts — and these use sine waves.\u000bEach term is of the form “b n times sine of two pi n t.”\u000bUnlike cosine, sine flips sign when you reflect it, so it captures the antisymmetric — or odd — behavior of the function.\nSo to sum up:\u000bWe build the full function using a constant term, plus a sum of cosine waves for the even part, and a sum of sine waves for the odd part. All of these components are weighted by their respective coefficients — a naught, a n, and b n.\n\nAnd here’s the elegant part:\u000bBecause we’re working with periodic functions, once you’ve reconstructed the signal over that one interval — from zero to one — the rest of the function just repeats automatically. It’s like tiling the pattern across the entire line.\n\nYou can see that idea illustrated in the image at the bottom of the slide.\u000bThe red waveform shows the reconstructed signal, and the lighter blue curves are the sine and cosine waves that contribute to it. When combined properly, they match the shape of the original function — and then extend it periodically to the left and right.\nThis kind of decomposition isn’t just theoretical — it has real meaning.\nThat constant term may represent a background level.\nThe even parts can capture symmetric patterns in your data.\nAnd the odd parts can highlight asymmetries, like sharp edges or sudden transitions.\n\nSo the Fourier series gives us a powerful, structured way to describe a function using just smooth, well-behaved waves — each one tied to a specific frequency and type of symmetry.\nAlright, now let’s move on and see how we can compute these coefficients — the values of a naught, a n, and b n — using projection.

That is:\ni squared equals minus one.\n\nNow, this seems counterintuitive, right? Because in the world of real numbers, squaring anything always gives you something non-negative. But here, we're stepping beyond the real line, into a new dimension — one that allows us to define numbers that include this imaginary unit.\nAnd that opens the door to complex numbers.\nA complex number, typically written as z, is defined as:\nz = x plus i times y,\nwhere x is the real part, and y is the imaginary part.\u000bGeometrically, you can think of this as a point on the complex plane — with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis.\nNow, for every complex number, we can define something called its conjugate.\u000bIf z is x plus i times y, then the conjugate of z, written with a bar over it, is:\nx minus I times y.\n\nThis is like flipping the point across the real axis — mirroring it vertically.\nNow, let’s look at how we add and multiply complex numbers.\u000bThe rules are very similar to regular algebra — you just have to remember that i squared is negative one. That’s the only twist.\nSo, for instance, if we add two complex numbers, we just add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately.\u000bIf we multiply them, we expand the product just like you would with binomials — but we substitute i squared with minus one when it appears.\nFrom here, we can also extract the real and imaginary parts of a complex number using its conjugate:\nThe real part is the average of the number and its conjugate — that’s z plus z bar divided by two.\nThe imaginary part is the difference between the number and its conjugate, divided by 2 i.\n\nNow, you might be wondering — how does all this tie back to Fourier analysis?\nWell, just as we defined inner products for real-valued functions, we can do the same for complex-valued functions.\u000bAnd when we do, we often need to deal with conjugates inside integrals.\n\nHere’s the rule:\u000bIf you take the complex conjugate of an integral — say, the integral of f of t times g of t — that’s equal to the integral of f conjugate times g conjugate.\nThis is especially important when we compute energy, projection, or coefficients in complex signal spaces.\n\nAlso, in engineering and physics, we frequently use the star notation — an asterisk — to indicate conjugation. So if you see a star on the outside of an integral, that means we’re conjugating the whole result.\u000bLikewise, when it’s applied to the functions inside, it means we're conjugating those functions individually.\nSo why go through all of this?\nBecause working with complex numbers — especially when combined with Euler’s formula, which we’ll see shortly — allows us to unify sine and cosine into a single, elegant expression. That’s a huge simplification.\n\nAnd that’s the real power of this approach:\u000bCleaner math, fewer terms, and deeper symmetry.\nSo with that, we’re now ready to look at the complex form of the Fourier series, which brings everything we've learned into one compact representation.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

This is what we’ve seen already:\u000bA complex number is written as x plus i times y, where x is the real part, and y is the imaginary part.\u000bSo we’re essentially giving the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a point in the complex plane — just like specifying a location on a map.\n\nNow, in engineering, we often replace the symbol i with j to represent the imaginary unit. This is purely to avoid confusion — because in electrical engineering, i is usually reserved for current.\u000bBut mathematically, i and j mean the same thing: they both satisfy the fundamental property that i squared equals negative one.\nThe other way to describe a complex number is through polar coordinates.\u000bInstead of saying how far right and up the point is, we describe the number by its magnitude and angle.\nSo what does that mean?\n\nWe draw a line from the origin to the point — that’s the complex number — and call its length r. That’s the magnitude, or modulus, and it’s calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\u000br equals the square root of x squared plus y squared.\u000bThis is also written as the absolute value of z.\n\nNext, we describe the angle that line makes with the positive real axis.\u000bThat angle is called theta, and we compute it as the inverse tangent of y over x.\u000bSo now, we have two pieces: r and theta — the magnitude and direction.\nWith that, we can now express the same complex number in polar form.\nIn place of x plus i y, we write:\nr times cosine theta plus i times r sine theta.\u000bOr, factoring out the r:\u000br times the quantity cosine theta plus i sine theta.\n\nThis is the foundation for something beautiful: Euler’s formula, which we’ll talk about in the next slide.\u000bEuler discovered that cosine theta plus i sine theta is equal to e to the i theta — giving us a powerful exponential representation of complex numbers.\nBefore we leave this slide, here’s one more important result:\u000bIf you multiply a complex number by its conjugate — in other words, z times z bar — you get a purely real number.\n\nLet’s walk through it:\u000bz is x plus i y, and its conjugate is x minus i y.\u000bWhen you multiply them together, you get x squared plus y squared, which is just the magnitude squared.\nThis shows that the conjugate cancels out the imaginary part, leaving only a real value — something very useful in analysis and signal processing.\nSo just like vectors, complex numbers let us switch back and forth between rectangular and polar systems.\u000b\nEach form brings its own advantages, and we’ll soon see how this flexibility pays off — especially when we start rewriting Fourier series using complex exponentials.\nLet’s move to Euler’s formula and take this further.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

That works just fine when we’re dealing with real-valued vectors.\nBut when we step into complex vector spaces, things get a bit more subtle. In particular, we have to be careful with how we define the inner product. In the complex world, it’s not enough to just multiply and add — we also need to take the complex conjugate of one of the vectors before doing so.\nLet’s break this down with a simple example.\n\nSuppose we have two complex vectors. Let’s call them X and Y.\nVector X has two components:\u000bthe first is a one plus b one times i,\u000band the second is a two plus b two times i.\nSimilarly, vector Y has components:\u000bc one plus d one times i,\u000band c two plus d two times i.\nNow, how do we compute the length of vector X?\n\u000bIn complex space, we use the sum of the squared magnitudes of each component. So the magnitude of X is the square root of\u000ba one squared plus b one squared plus a two squared plus b two squared.\nWe do the same for vector Y — square the real and imaginary parts of each component, add them up, and then take the square root.\n\nNow, here’s the key idea.\nIf these two complex vectors — X and Y — are orthogonal, and we add them together to form a new vector Z, we expect the squared length of Z to equal the squared length of X plus the squared length of Y. That’s just the Pythagorean theorem in vector space.\nBut for that identity to hold, one critical condition must be met:\u000bthe cross-term — the inner product between X and Y — must vanish. In other words, the inner product between X and Y has to be zero.\nAnd this is where the complex conjugate becomes important.\n\nIn real vector spaces, we just take the dot product. But in complex spaces, we define the inner product as:\u000bX dot Y conjugate.\nThat means, we keep vector X as it is, and we take the complex conjugate of each component of Y before multiplying.\nThis adjustment ensures that everything works out mathematically:\u000bwe preserve orthogonality, we maintain proper lengths, and we uphold the geometry of the space.\nSo, whenever we’re working with complex vectors — in signal processing, in quantum mechanics, or in Fourier analysis — this conjugation step is absolutely essential.\n\nNow, don’t worry about memorizing the formulas. That’s why I added this green bubble here — it’s just a reminder that this is more about understanding the concept than remembering every detail.\nOnce you internalize this idea — that conjugation is needed to define meaningful inner products in complex space — everything that follows, including the complex form of the Fourier series, will feel much more natural.\nLet’s now move forward and apply this idea in the Fourier domain.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

You multiply corresponding components and sum the results. But in a complex space, if we follow that same rule — just multiplying and summing — we may end up with a complex number. And that’s a problem, because when we’re measuring things like length, or comparing angles between vectors, we need real values.\n\nSo here’s what we do instead.\nWe define the inner product of two complex-valued functions, let’s say f of t and g of t, by integrating the product of f of t and the complex conjugate of g of t.\nSymbolically, we write:\u000b⟨f of t, g of t⟩ equals the integral from minus infinity to infinity of f of t times g star of t, d t.\n\nThat’s our general definition. But often, we work over a specific interval — for example, from zero to one. In that case, we write:\u000b⟨f of t, g of t⟩ equals the integral from 0 to 1 of f of t times g star of t, d t.\n\nNow, why is this conjugation so important?\nWell, imagine taking the inner product of a function with itself. We’d expect that result to be real and non-negative — something that represents the square of the function’s length or its energy. But without the conjugate, we might get a complex number, which doesn’t make physical sense in that context.\nThe conjugate takes care of that. It ensures the phase — or directional twist — of the complex function is canceled out. What’s left is the amplitude — the magnitude — and that’s what we care about when computing lengths or measuring how much two functions align.\n\nAnother way to see this is: the conjugate helps us ignore the phase and focus purely on the size or strength of the signal.\nSo this isn’t just a technical tweak — it’s what makes the geometry of complex spaces work. Thanks to the conjugate, we preserve all the essential properties:\u000borthogonality, projection, the norm — and more.\nSo when we say two complex-valued functions are orthogonal, we mean that their inner product — including the conjugate — is zero. That’s the complex equivalent of vectors being at right angles.\nThis is why conjugates appear everywhere in Fourier analysis and other areas involving complex functions. They ensure consistency and meaning across the entire framework.\n\nSo, to summarize:\u000bIn complex function spaces, an inner product is defined using integration with conjugation.\u000bThat’s the key idea — and it makes everything else fall neatly into place.\nUp next, we’ll use this inner product to compute the complex Fourier coefficients.\nLet’s move forward.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

You might remember that the exponential of a number can be written as an infinite series. For any complex number z, we can write:\n“e to the z equals one, plus z over one factorial, plus z squared over two factorial, plus z cubed over three factorial, and so on.”\nIn math terms, that’s:\n  e to the z equals the sum from n equals zero to infinity of z to the n over n factorial.\nThis series works not only for real numbers, but also for complex numbers. And that’s important.\nHow do we know this infinite sum still makes sense when z is complex? Well, there’s something called the ratio test, which shows that this series converges no matter what complex number we use. In other words, it always gives a valid result. That’s why we can define e to the z for any complex number z. That’s a big deal.\n\nNow, here’s where things get really exciting.\nWhat if we plug in a purely imaginary number, like i times theta, into this exponential?\nIt turns out that:\n  e to the i theta equals cosine theta plus i times sine theta.\nThat’s Euler’s formula.\n\nThis equation is incredibly elegant. It shows how exponential functions and trigonometric functions—two ideas that seem totally different—are actually deeply connected.\nAnd here’s something even more useful. If you rearrange Euler’s formula a bit, you can write cosine and sine in terms of complex exponentials.\n\nSpecifically:\n  Cosine theta equals e to the i theta plus e to the minus i theta, divided by two.\n  Sine theta equals e to the i theta minus e to the minus i theta, divided by two i.\nThese two identities are incredibly helpful, especially in signal processing and Fourier analysis. They let us replace sines and cosines with exponentials, which makes the math much cleaner and often easier to compute.\n\nSo to sum up:\nEuler’s formula is a bridge between the world of waves—like sine and cosine—and the world of exponentials. And as we’ll see next, that bridge is exactly what we need to rewrite the Fourier series in a compact, exponential form.\nLet’s move forward and take a look at that next.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

We’ve seen that it works well, but it requires us to carry around both sine and cosine terms—and two separate sets of coefficients.\n\nNow here’s the trick: using Euler’s formula, we can rewrite sine and cosine using complex exponentials.\nFor example, cosine of two pi n t becomes:\n  \"e to the power i times two pi n t, plus e to the power negative i times two pi n t, all divided by two.\"\nAnd sine of two pi n t becomes:\n  \"e to the i two pi n t, minus e to the negative i two pi n t, all divided by two i.\"\n\nSo what’s the point of doing this?\nWell, once we’ve written everything in terms of exponentials, we can merge the sine and cosine parts into one unified expression.

Let’s say we have e n t and e m t, and n is not equal to m.\nSince we’re in a complex function space, remember that we have to conjugate the second function when we compute the inner product.\u000bSo, the inner product between e n and e m is:\u000b  \"The integral from zero to one of e to the two pi i n t, times the complex conjugate of e to the two pi i m t.\"\u000b\nNow, taking the conjugate of an exponential just flips the sign in the exponent.

This confirms that the functions are orthogonal when n and m are different.\u000b\n\nNow, what if n equals m?\u000bThen the exponent becomes zero, so we’re simply integrating the constant function one, from zero to one.

And the corresponding coefficient, c n, tells us how much of that frequency is present in the signal.\u000b\nNow, how do we find each coefficient?\u000bBecause our basis functions are orthonormal, we can isolate any one coefficient simply by taking the inner product of f with the exponential function e to the i two pi n t.

Each dimension in this space corresponds to a different basis function—just like in three-dimensional space, where we have the x, y, and z axes.\nOn the left side of this slide, you see the real basis. These are made up of the constant function 1, the cosine functions like cosine of 2 pi m t, and the sine functions like sine of 2 pi n t. These real functions are all orthonormal, and together, they span the space of all square-integrable periodic functions.\n\nNow notice the red arrow labeled f of t. That red arrow represents a function. And just like any vector in 3D space, we can express this function as a sum of its components in each direction. But in our case, the directions are sine, cosine, and the constant function.\nTo figure out how much of each component is present, we project the function onto each basis function. That’s exactly what we’re doing when we compute the Fourier coefficients. We're just asking: how much of cosine is in this signal? How much of sine? And so on.\n\nNow look at the right-hand diagram. It shows the same idea, but using a complex basis instead. Here, the directions are complex exponentials like e to the i 2 pi n t. These complex exponentials are also orthonormal and form a complete basis in the complex function space.\nThe red arrow here, labeled g of t, could represent the same function as f of t. But now, it’s decomposed using complex components instead of sines and cosines.\nSo whether we use real functions or complex exponentials, the concept is the same: we're decomposing a function into its “directional” components in function space—just like how you decompose a 3D vector into its x, y, and z parts.\n\nThis visualization helps us see Fourier series not just as a bunch of formulas—but as a geometric idea. A function is a vector, and we’re expressing it as a sum of basis vectors.\nThis is the heart of Fourier analysis.\nNext, let’s take a look at some concrete examples to see how this actually plays out in practice.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Then, from one-half to one, it suddenly drops to minus one. After that, the pattern repeats. And again. And again. This continues infinitely in both directions along the time axis.\nSo overall, this is a piecewise function. Within each period, it's constant in two segments, with an abrupt jump at the halfway point. And because it repeats every unit of time, we say it has a period of one.\n\nNow, at first glance, you might think, “This function is too rough for sine and cosine to handle.” It has sharp edges, and it jumps suddenly. But that’s where the power of Fourier analysis shines.\nEven though the square wave is not smooth, we can still represent it as a sum of smooth, continuous sinusoids. It’s exactly this kind of jumpy, discontinuous behavior that makes the square wave such a great test case for the Fourier series.\n\nYou’ll soon see that we can approximate the square wave by adding up enough sine components. And the more terms we include, the closer the sum will come to capturing that sharp transition from plus one to minus one.\nThis example will also reveal an interesting phenomenon known as the Gibbs effect, which we’ll talk about next.\nBut for now, just keep in mind: even for a simple-looking function like this square wave, Fourier series gives us a powerful and systematic way to build it up—using only smooth building blocks.\n\nSo now let’s take the next step and compute the Fourier coefficients for our square wave.\n\nAs we saw before, the square wave alternates between plus one and minus one over each period. From zero to one-half, it’s plus one. From one-half to one, it drops to minus one. And this pattern repeats every unit interval.\n\nNow, we begin with the zeroth Fourier coefficient. This represents the average value of the function over one period. But notice: for every positive bump, there’s a negative one of equal size. So the total area above the axis cancels out the area below. That means the average value is zero.\nSo, the zeroth term disappears.\n\nNext, we compute the other Fourier coefficients, often denoted by f-hat of n. These are obtained by taking the inner product of the function with the complex exponential e to the negative 2 pi i n t.\nSince our square wave has two constant segments, we split the integral into two parts: one from 0 to one-half, where the function equals plus one, and one from one-half to 1, where the function equals minus one.\nWe integrate e to the negative 2 pi i n t over each of these intervals, then subtract them.\n\nAfter doing the math, we arrive at this compact expression:\nF hat n equals to 1 over pi i n times the quantity 1 minus e to the negative pi i n.\n\nNow this is an elegant formula. It tells us exactly how strong each frequency component is. For each integer value of n—not equal to zero—we get a corresponding complex exponential that contributes to building up the square wave.\n\nAnd so, we write the full Fourier series as an infinite sum of these terms. That is, summing over all non-zero values of n:\nThe sum of 1 over pi i n times 1 minus e to the negative pi i n times e to the 2 pi i n t\nEach of these exponential functions corresponds to a specific frequency, and each coefficient tells us how much of that frequency is present in the signal.\nOn the next slide, we’ll further simplify this result and begin to see the pattern more clearly—especially for odd harmonics.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

What happens when n is even?\n\nWell, if you plug in an even number, this expression becomes zero. That means: all even-numbered terms in the series disappear completely. On the other hand, when n is odd, this term evaluates to two.\nSo what does this tell us? It tells us that the square wave is made up only of odd harmonics. That is, only the sine waves whose frequencies are odd multiples of the base frequency will appear in the final expression.\nWith this insight, we rewrite the series, summing over only the odd values of n. And since the numerator is just 2 now, the coefficient simplifies to 2 over pi i n, multiplied by e to the 2 pi i n t.\n\nNow we go one step further. We combine the terms for plus n and minus n. When we do that and apply Euler’s identity again, something beautiful happens. The sum of e to the i theta and e to the negative i theta becomes a sine function. Specifically:\ne to the 2 pi i n t minus e to the minus 2 pi i n t equals 2 i times sine of 2 pi n t\nSo now, our series, which originally looked complex and full of exponentials, becomes a clean sine series.\nWe make one last substitution. Since we’re only keeping odd values of n, we can write n as 2 k plus 1, where k runs from zero to infinity.\n\nThis gives us the final, elegant result:\nf of t equals 4 over pi, times the sum from k equals 0 to infinity, of 1 over 2 k plus 1, times sine of 2 pi times 2 k plus 1 t\nThis is the Fourier series for the square wave.\n\nNotice how only sine terms appear. That makes perfect sense, because the square wave is an odd function—it’s symmetric around the origin. And in Fourier analysis, odd functions naturally expand into sine terms, just like even functions expand into cosines.\nThis result is not only beautiful but also extremely useful. It tells us exactly how to build a square wave by layering together the right sine waves, each scaled just right.\nLet’s go on and see what this looks like when we actually approximate the square wave with a few of these terms.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

But in practice, we can only sum up a limited number of them. So what does that mean?\n\nWell, in regions where the function is smooth and continuous, like in the middle of a flat section of the square wave, the approximation is excellent. The series follows the shape of the function very closely, and the error becomes negligible as we include more terms.\nBut notice what happens at the discontinuities—those sudden jumps where the function goes from 1 to 1. That’s where the series begins to struggle.\n\nIf you look at the plot here, you’ll see a ripple near each jump. These ripples don’t go away even if we add more and more terms. This phenomenon is known as the Gibbs phenomenon, and we’ll explore it in detail shortly.\nFor now, focus on what the formula in the blue box is telling us. It describes the value that the Fourier series converges to at each point x.\nIf the function f of x is continuous at that point, then the Fourier series converges to f of x. That’s simple enough.\nBut if the function is discontinuous, then the series converges to the average of the left-hand and right-hand limits. Mathematically, that means:\nS of x equals one-half times f of x from the left, plus f of x from the right\n\nSo the series doesn’t “miss” the function entirely at the jump—it just lands at the midpoint. This is a subtle but important point: the Fourier series always converges to something, and that something is precisely defined.\nIn summary, finite Fourier series work very well across most of the domain, but they introduce oscillations and errors around jumps. That’s an inherent limitation of this type of approximation—and next, we’ll give this behavior a name and look more closely at its mathematical structure.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

It’s known as the Gibbs effect.\n\nLet’s revisit what we saw on the previous slide. When we try to approximate a function with a sudden jump, like our square wave, the Fourier series doesn’t quite nail the jump. Instead, it creates an oscillatory overshoot near the point of discontinuity. You can see these ripples in the red-highlighted regions on this plot.\n\nWhat’s important to understand here is that this overshoot doesn’t disappear—even if we use hundreds or thousands of terms. Yes, the oscillations become more tightly packed, clustering closer to the jump. But the height of the overshoot—the peak error—does not go away.\nIt approaches a fixed value—about 9 percent of the jump in the function. That’s the defining feature of the Gibbs effect.\n\nSo why does this happen? Well, the Fourier series is built from smooth, continuous waves—like sines and cosines or complex exponentials. But when we try to represent a sharp edge—a discontinuity—using only smooth components, we hit a fundamental limit. There’s no perfect way to form a step out of waves.\nThis mismatch creates those persistent ripples. It’s not a bug in the method—it’s a deep mathematical truth.\n\nSo even though the Fourier approximation converges pointwise almost everywhere, and even in the sense of least squares, it never perfectly resolves a jump. This is especially important in applications like signal processing or image reconstruction, where sharp edges and sudden transitions often appear.\nThe takeaway is: when you see these ringing effects around edges in a Fourier approximation, you're witnessing the Gibbs effect in action.\nLet’s now bring all this together with a final reflection on what we’ve learned from the square wave example.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

But in real applications, that’s not always the case. The period might be two, five, or even some irrational number like pi. So how do we handle that?\n\nIt turns out the Fourier series still works perfectly—we just need to adjust our formula to account for the actual period, which we’ll call capital T.\nThe idea is simple: we scale the time variable by dividing it by T. That way, we bring the problem back into a familiar form—similar to what we did when the period was one.\n\nSo the Fourier series becomes:\nf of t equals the sum over all n from negative infinity to infinity of c n times e to the power i 2 pi n t over T.\n\nLet me say that again more slowly:\nWe write the function f of t as the sum of c n times e raised to the power i times two pi times n times t divided by T.\nNow what about the coefficients?\nWe compute c n using an integral over one full period. And we have two equivalent options for that:\n\nFirst option:\nc n equals one over T times the integral from zero to capital T of f of t times e to the power negative i 2 pi n t over T, integrated with respect to t.\nOr, second option:\nc n equals one over T times the integral from negative T over 2 to positive T over 2 of f of t times e to the power negative i 2 pi n t over T, again integrated with respect to t.\n\nEither form works. The only difference is the range of integration—whether you go from zero to T or from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2.\n\nSo what’s the takeaway?\nThis is just a change of variable. We're scaling time so that the period becomes one, applying all our previous results, and then scaling back.\n\nThis gives us a general version of the Fourier series that works for any period—not just the special case where the period is one.\nAnd this flexibility is exactly what makes the Fourier series so powerful. It adapts easily to the structure of whatever signal you're analyzing.\nUp next, we’ll take this idea even further and connect it to the Fourier transform, which is what happens when the period becomes infinitely large.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

But in real-world applications—especially in imaging—we usually work with two-dimensional data. Think about a photograph, a CT slice, or an MRI frame. These are functions of two variables, not just one.\nSo, does the Fourier series still apply? Absolutely. In fact, the transition to two dimensions is very smooth and intuitive.\n\nLet’s start with the formula at the top. This is the 2D Fourier transform, or more precisely, the 2D discrete Fourier series. It converts a spatial domain function into a frequency domain representation.\n\nWe begin with a function f of m and n. Here, m and n are the spatial coordinates, like pixel row and column indices.\nThen we compute the capital F of x and y, which is the frequency-domain representation of the image. We get it using a double summation—from m equals 0 to M minus 1, and from n equals 0 to N minus 1.\nEach term in the sum includes f of m and n, multiplied by a complex exponential:\u000be to the power negative j 2 pi times x times m over M plus y times n over N.\nThis is just the 2D extension of what we did before in 1D—now applied along both spatial directions.\n\nNext, let’s look at the inverse transform—the formula at the bottom.\nHere, we reconstruct the original image, f of m and n, from its frequency components, F of x and y. Again, we use a double summation ranging from 0 to M minus 1 and N minus 1.\nAnd we add a normalization factor of 1 divided by M times N.\nThe exponential now becomes:\u000be to the power positive j 2 pi times x times m over M plus y times n over N.\n\nSo once again, we’re projecting onto a set of complex exponential basis functions—just like in the 1D case, but now expanded to two dimensions.\nThis idea even extends naturally to three dimensions, which is useful for things like volumetric imaging, 3D scans, or dynamic time-sequence data in medical imaging.\n\nSo to summarize: the 2D Fourier series gives us a powerful way to analyze images in terms of spatial frequencies.

Yes — a collection of sharp, narrow spikes, each carrying a little bit of information about the function at a specific time.\n\nThis is where the Dirac delta function, or delta for short, comes in. From linear systems theory, we know that any continuous function can be viewed as the convolution of that function with a train of delta functions.\n\nWhat does this mean, intuitively? It means you can imagine slicing the original function into many tiny segments. Each segment becomes a small impulse — and when you add up all those impulses, you reconstruct the full function.\nSo, this is one way to represent a function — not as a smooth line, but as a weighted sum of sharp impulses.

The rest are just copies.\nThe key idea is this: a periodic function like this can be broken down into many sine and cosine waves — we call these sinusoidal components. These waves can vary in three ways: their frequency, which tells us how fast they oscillate; their amplitude, which tells us how tall they are; and their phase, which tells us where each wave starts.\n\nSo what’s the trick? We want to find the right combination of amplitudes, frequencies, and phases — so that when we add up all these sine and cosine waves, we recover the original function.\nAt first, this might sound abstract, but conceptually it’s not that difficult. You’re just looking at the same function in a different way.\nEarlier, we saw a kind of particle view — slicing the function into sharp impulses. Now we’re seeing a wave view — smoothing it into oscillating signals.\nAnd this wave-based view is the foundation for Fourier analysis.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

The higher the value of n, the higher the frequency of that term.\n\nSo the general formula goes like this:\nf of t equals a-zero over 2, plus the sum from n equals 1 to N of a-n times cosine of 2 pi n t, plus b-n times sine of 2 pi n t.\nNow, where do these coefficients come from?\nWell, we have formulas to compute them. That’s the trick!\nTo find a zero, you integrate f of t from 0 to 1.\nTo find a-n, you multiply f of t with cosine of 2 pi n t, and integrate.\nAnd for b-n, you do the same, but with sine of 2 pi n t.\n\nSo if I give you any function f of t, you just plug it into these formulas, do the math, and you get a set of numbers — the a’s and b’s. With those coefficients, you can then reconstruct the original function by summing all the sine and cosine waves.\nAs N gets larger — meaning you include more wave components — the reconstructed function becomes more and more accurate. In fact, when N approaches infinity, this series can represent the function exactly, under reasonable conditions.\n\nNow here’s something deeper: These sine and cosine functions form an orthonormal basis — that’s just a fancy way of saying they’re like the X, Y, and Z axes in 3D space, but in an infinite-dimensional space of functions.\nSo geometrically, what you're doing is projecting the function f of t onto each basis function — kind of like breaking a 3D vector into its X, Y, and Z components. Except here, we’re breaking a function into sine, cosine, and constant components.\n\nIf this all feels a bit abstract, don’t worry. The key takeaway is:\u000bWe’re representing a function as a sum of waves.\u000bAnd we have formulas that let us find the right weights — or coefficients — for those waves.\nThat’s what the Fourier series, in its real form, is all about.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

But there's another way to write the same idea — in what we call the complex form.\n\nNow don’t be alarmed by the word “complex.” This version is mathematically equivalent to the real form — it's just more compact and elegant.\nInstead of separating things into sines and cosines, we use complex exponentials — specifically, e to the power of 2 pi i n t. That’s Euler’s formula at work.\nIn this form, the function f of t is expressed as a sum — from n equals minus N to N — of coefficients c n multiplied by e to the 2 pi i n t.\nAnd just like before, we need to figure out those coefficients. So how do we compute c n?\n\nWe use this formula:\u000bc n equals the integral from 0 to 1 of e to the power minus 2 pi i n t times f of t, with respect to t.\nThis is essentially an inner product — projecting your function onto the exponential basis function e to the power minus 2 pi i n t. \n\nIn my book, I like to write the imaginary unit i in front — as in minus i 2 pi n t — but it’s just a matter of notation. The meaning stays the same.\nAt the bottom here, you see the same formula written slightly differently — as f-hat of n — which is just another way of naming the coefficient.\n\nNow, throughout this slide, we’re assuming that the function is periodic with unit period — meaning it repeats every interval from 0 to 1. If the function instead repeats from, say, 100 to 101, it’s still the same picture — just shifted.\nSo the complex form doesn't change the logic — it simply gives us a cleaner, more powerful way to write and manipulate Fourier series, especially when we move into Fourier transforms.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

That means the function repeats every one unit of time, say, from 0 to 1.\n\nBut what if the period is something else — like 5, or 100? That’s what we’re covering here.\nThis slide shows how to handle a function with an arbitrary period, which we’ll call capital T. The good news is: the concept stays exactly the same — we’re still breaking the function into complex exponential components — but we just adjust the formulas a bit.\n\nHere’s how the function f of t is now written:\nf of t equals the sum from n equals minus infinity to infinity of c n times e to the power i 2 pi n t over T.\nSo you can think of this as a generalized version of the complex Fourier series.\n\nAnd to compute the coefficient c n, we use the formula:\nc n equals 1 over capital T, times the integral from minus T over 2 to T over 2 of e to the power minus i 2 pi n t over T, which is multiplied by f of t, with respect to t.\n\nNow let me break that down for you:\nThe exponential term — that’s your harmonic basis function, adjusted for the new period.\nt over T is just a way to normalize time, so that we’re still operating over a standard interval.\nThe 1 over T in front is a scaling factor that makes everything work out correctly.\nAnd the range of integration — from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2 — gives us a symmetric interval, which is often more convenient for analysis.\n\nSo, whether your period is 1, 10, or any other positive number, you simply use T in place of 1 and apply this formula. You’re still summing wave-like components — just stretched or compressed in time depending on the period.\nNow here’s something helpful:\u000bIf you set T equals 1, this formula reduces back to the unit-period version we saw before. So you only need to remember this general form — and adjust T as needed.\n\nIn practice, the real form of the Fourier series is nice because it gives you a clear geometric picture — sines, cosines, and their amplitudes.\u000bThe complex form, like the one we see here, is more compact and elegant, especially when we move into transforms.

Why even bother with the Fourier transform?\nWell, let’s take a step back and think with common sense.\n\nWe started with a function — f of t — and we’ve looked at several ways to represent it. First, we saw it as a sum of impulses. Then, as a sum of waves — sines and cosines. Each of these views gives us a different lens to understand the same signal.\nAnd that’s the point. Multiple perspectives give us more flexibility and smarter strategies for solving problems.\n\nIn real life, when you're facing a tough task, what do you usually do? You don’t try to tackle it head-on in the hardest way possible. You try to simplify it. You look for shortcuts. You use tools that make the problem easier.\nThat’s exactly what we’re doing with Fourier analysis.\nSometimes a problem looks really messy in the time domain — but if we switch to the Fourier domain, that same problem might become simple and elegant.\n\nHere’s an analogy: imagine trying to do multiplication using Roman numerals. It’s a nightmare! But switch to Arabic numerals — or even binary — and suddenly, multiplication becomes easy. Especially for computers.\nSo choosing the right representation can make all the difference.\nThat’s what the Fourier transform is all about. It gives us a new way to look at a function — in terms of its frequency content — and often, that view makes analysis or computation much simpler.\n\nThere’s also a deeper strategy here:\u000bSometimes a function is complicated as a whole, but if we break it down into smaller, simpler parts, we can understand it better.\nThis is the classic divide and conquer approach.\nWe’ve already seen this with impulse decomposition. If you know how a system responds to a single impulse, then you can figure out how it will respond to a complicated signal — just by adding up the responses to each impulse.\nThe same logic applies to sine waves — if you understand how a system reacts to one sine wave, and you can express a signal as a sum of sine waves, then you’ve got the whole picture.\n\nSo, in short, Fourier analysis follows two powerful principles:\nUse simple tools to solve complex problems.\nDivide big problems into small, manageable pieces.\nAnd that’s what we’re building toward with the Fourier transform.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

In this case, we’re looking at a symmetric interval — from minus capital T over 2 to plus capital T over 2.\n\nWithin this interval, we can represent the function f of t as a sum of sinusoidal components — specifically, complex exponentials of the form:\ne to the power i times 2 pi n, times t over T.\nThis is a compact way to write sine and cosine waves using Euler’s formula. So even though the expression looks complex, it represents a mix of sine and cosine waves at various frequencies, where n runs from minus infinity to plus infinity.\nAnd just like before, each component has a corresponding coefficient, which tells us how much of that wave appears in the overall function.\n\nTo compute the coefficient c n, we use the formula at the bottom:\nc n equals 1 over capital T, times the integral from minus T over 2 to T over 2, of e to the minus i 2 pi n t over T, times f of t, with respect to t.\nThis is just an inner product — projecting f of t onto a complex exponential basis function. That projection gives us the weight, or the contribution, of that particular frequency.\n\nSo, this slide wraps up all the key ideas from the Fourier series — including:\nTreating functions as periodic,\nExpressing them with complex exponentials,\nAnd computing coefficients through integration.\nWith this solid foundation in place, we’re now ready to take the next step — and derive the Fourier transform, which generalizes everything we’ve done so far.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

Now, we’re going to insert that expression for c n directly into the Fourier series formula.\n\nWhat happens when we do that?\nWell, here’s what we get: we take the formula for c n — which is an integral — and plug it into the sum. So now, each term in the series contains an inner product multiplied by a complex exponential.\n\nNotice this part out front: 1 over capital T. This shows up because we’re working over a general period T, not the unit interval. So we need to normalize — or average — over the full interval from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2.\nThis 1 over T acts like a scaling factor — a way of balancing the sum so that everything works out correctly.\nNow look inside the brackets. What we’re really doing here is taking the inner product of two functions:\nOne is f of t,\nAnd the other is the complex exponential e to the power minus i 2 pi n t over T.\n\nYou multiply them together point by point, and then integrate over the interval. That’s what we mean by an inner product in this context.\nAnd we’re doing this for many values of n, both negative and positive. So you can imagine we’re computing inner products at a whole series of frequency points — where each frequency is n divided by T.\n\nAs T becomes large, the spacing between these frequencies — that is, the difference between one n over T and the next — becomes smaller and smaller. Eventually, this sum will start to resemble an integral over a continuous range of frequencies, and that’s the key idea behind the Fourier transform.\n\nSo, to summarize:\u000bWe’re inserting the formula for c n, and that gives us a series of inner products across many frequencies, with a spacing of delta u equals 1 over T. This step sets us up perfectly to move from a discrete sum to a continuous integral — which is what the Fourier transform is all about.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

Each of these points corresponds to a value of n divided by capital T — that is, u equals n over T. As n varies from negative to positive integers, you get a collection of frequency points spread along the u-axis, which represents frequency.\n\nWhen n equals 0, you’re at the DC component — the zero-frequency term. When n equals 1, you get one frequency point. When n equals minus 1, you get another. And so on.\nSo you can imagine each vertical line here as one of those frequency points — u equals n over T — spread across the axis.\n\nNow here’s the key idea:\u000bIf we let the period T become very large, then the range from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2 will grow wider and wider. In fact, in the limit as T goes to infinity, that interval covers the entire frequency axis — from minus infinity to plus infinity.\n\nThat’s what we mean by dense sampling of frequency.\nAs T increases, the spacing between neighboring frequencies gets smaller and smaller. Mathematically, the spacing — which we call delta u — becomes 1 over capital T. So the gap between u equals to n over T and u equals to (n plus 1) over T shrinks.\nEventually, these discrete frequency samples get so close together that they begin to form a continuous spectrum.\nAnd that’s the magic.\n\nWe started with a periodic function, which gives us discrete frequencies. But as the period stretches toward infinity, the function becomes non-periodic, and the discrete frequency points turn into a continuous frequency range.\nSo, what is a non-periodic function in this view?\nIt’s just a periodic function with an infinitely long period. Anything that happens beyond that infinite window doesn’t affect what we see — and that’s how we bridge from the Fourier series to the Fourier transform.\n\nThis slide captures the big picture:\nDiscrete frequencies spaced by 1 over T,\nBecoming densely packed as T increases,\nAnd ultimately forming a continuous frequency axis.\nThat’s our gateway into the Fourier transform.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

Take a moment to follow this carefully, because here is where we formally derive the Fourier transform — and also see how we can recover the original function using the inverse transform.\n\nLet’s begin at the top.\nWe’re starting with our expression for f of t, written as a Fourier series. We substitute the expression for c over n — the Fourier coefficient — right into this formula.\n\nNow remember, c over n contains an integral — and it includes a 1 over T term out front. Since T is constant, we pull it out of the sum.\nAt this point, we apply a key idea we introduced earlier:\u000bLet T become very large, so large that we’re effectively dealing with a non-periodic function. When T approaches infinity, the spacing between the frequency samples, delta u equals to 1 over T, becomes tiny — almost zero.\n\nSo what happens?\nInstead of summing over discrete frequencies, we move to a continuous frequency variable, which we call u — where u equals n divided by T.\nThis transition lets us replace the sum with an integral.\nSo now we’ve gone from a sum of discrete terms to an integral over a continuous range of frequencies. The inner product becomes f-hat of u, the Fourier transform of f of t. And the exponential term becomes e to the power i 2 pi u t — our new kernel in the transform.\n\nLet’s pause here and look at the final expression.\nYou’ll notice two things:\nFirst, to compute f-hat of u, the Fourier transform, we integrate f of t multiplied by e to the minus i 2 pi u t. That’s the forward transform — moving from the time domain to the frequency domain.\nSecond, to reconstruct f of t, we take f-hat of u, multiply it by e to the power i 2 pi u t, and integrate over all u. That’s the inverse transform — bringing us back from frequency to time.\nSo these two formulas — the forward and inverse transforms — are the foundation of the Fourier transform.\n\nThey let us take a non-periodic function and decompose it into a continuous spectrum of frequencies. And then, using that spectrum, we can reconstruct the original function with complete accuracy.\nThis is what makes the Fourier transform so powerful — not just mathematically, but also practically — in fields like signal processing, image analysis, and, of course, medical imaging.\nFrom this point forward, we’re now working with non-periodic functions, and we’ve fully transitioned from Fourier series to the Fourier transform.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

We can now handle functions like this — compact, finite, non-repeating — and still express them in terms of sinusoidal components, just over a continuous range of frequencies.\nSo this rectangular function — although it’s simple — gives us a great opportunity to visualize the power of the Fourier transform.\nLet’s keep going and see what it looks like in the frequency domain.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

We just need to make the function periodic.\nAnd here’s how we do it: we take that single gate function — and simply repeat it over and over again, at regular intervals. This is called periodization.\n\nIn this slide, the original gate function is being repeated with a period of 16.

The goal is to understand how much of each frequency is present in that signal.\n\nSo how do we do that?\nWe project f of t onto a family of complex exponential functions. These functions look like e to the power minus i, 2 pi, u, t, where u is the frequency. This projection acts like an inner product, telling us how strongly f of t resonates with each frequency component.\nWhen we integrate this product across all time, we obtain f hat of u, also called the frequency spectrum or the Fourier transform of f of t.\nSo this first equation maps the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nNow look at the second equation. This is the inverse Fourier transform.\nHere, we take all those frequency components — that is, each f hat of u — and multiply them by their corresponding complex exponential, this time e to the power i, two pi, u, t. Then, we integrate over all frequencies.\nAnd what do we get?\u000bWe reconstruct the original signal — f of t — exactly.\nSo in summary, the forward transform takes you from time to frequency, and the inverse transform brings you back from frequency to time.\u000bThat’s the two-way mapping shown symbolically at the bottom:\u000bf of t goes to f hat of u, and back again.\n\nNow, a few mathematical notes to make this complete:\nFirst — this transform assumes that f of t is square-integrable, meaning if you square the function and integrate it over all time, the total is finite. This ensures convergence and makes the math work properly.\n\nSecond — even though we’re dealing with a non-periodic function here, the idea still grows out of the Fourier series. Remember what happens when the period of a function becomes very large — the discrete set of frequency components becomes a continuous spectrum. The Fourier transform is essentially the limit of the Fourier series as the period tends to infinity.\nAnd finally — here’s a nice geometric interpretation.\nThink of projecting a 3D vector onto the x, y, and z axes.\u000b\nIn the same way, when we apply the Fourier transform, we’re projecting our function onto an infinite set of sine and cosine waves — or more precisely, complex exponentials. Each frequency contributes a tiny slice of the original signal.\u000bAnd by adding all those slices back together — using integration — we reconstruct the full signal.\n\nThis isn’t just a clever trick.\u000bIt’s one of the most powerful tools in all of engineering, physics, and mathematics.\u000bIt lets us analyze and manipulate signals in both time and frequency — without losing any information.\nWith this foundational concept in place, we’re ready to explore some practical examples and dive deeper into the properties of the Fourier transform.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

It’s a flat function that equals 1 when the time variable t is between minus one-half and plus one-half, and it’s zero everywhere else. So it looks like a rectangle centered at zero.\n\nNow, we want to find its Fourier transform. To do that, we apply the definition.\nWe take the integral of the original function multiplied by a complex exponential — that’s e to the power negative i 2 pi u t — and we integrate over all time.\n\nBut since the gate function is zero outside the interval from minus one-half to plus one-half, we only need to integrate over that range.\nSo the integral becomes: from minus one-half to plus one-half of e to the negative i 2 pi u t, with respect to t.\nThis is a standard exponential integral. When you solve it, you get the function sine of pi u, divided by pi u.\nThis result is known as the sinc function and it shows up everywhere in signal processing and imaging.\nSo here’s what we’ve found: a rectangle in time turns into a sinc wave in frequency. That’s a beautiful and very useful result.\n\nNow, what if we stretch the gate to make it wider?\nLet’s say the gate equals 1 from minus capital T over 2 to plus T over 2, and zero elsewhere. Then the Fourier transform becomes a scaled version of the same sinc function — it just shrinks or stretches based on the value of T.\nSo you could try computing it directly, or you could use a shortcut — the scaling property of the Fourier transform, which we’ll talk about soon.\n\nBut the key point is this: the rectangular function in time gives us a sinc function in frequency.\nAnd here’s one final note. You might wonder what happens when u equals zero, because both the top and bottom become zero. But don’t worry — if you take the limit using calculus, it turns out the value is exactly 1. So the function is smooth at the center.\nWe’ll use this gate-to-sinc pair often, so keep it in mind as we move forward.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

The peak is right at the center — at u equals zero — and the height there is exactly 1.\nAs you move away from the center in either direction, the function oscillates — it goes up and down — but the peaks get smaller and smaller.\nThat’s because the sine wave in the numerator keeps swinging, but the denominator grows, so the overall value shrinks.\nThis is the signature look of the sinc function — one strong central lobe and then smaller and smaller ripples on the sides.\n\nSo this is the frequency domain representation of a simple gate in time.\nAnd just to recap — this sinc function came from a rectangular gate function of width 1.\nIf we use a wider gate — let’s say the width is capital T instead of 1 — then the sinc function would stretch out horizontally.

Outside of that range, the value is zero.\n\nMathematically, it’s defined like this: one minus the absolute value of x when x is between negative 1 and 1, and zero otherwise.\nSo what we want to do now is find its Fourier transform.\n\nIn other words, we want to express this smooth, non-periodic triangular function as a combination of infinitely many sinusoidal waves — just like we did with the gate function.\n\nWe’ll add up all these waves — each with a different frequency and amplitude — and by doing so, we’ll be able to reconstruct this triangle shape exactly.\nThat’s the idea behind Fourier transform: take a function, no matter how it looks, and rewrite it as a sum of wave components.

In the time domain, it’s written as e to the power negative pi t squared. This is the familiar bell-shaped curve — smooth, centered, and decaying quickly. What’s remarkable is that its Fourier transform is also a Gaussian — e to the power negative pi u squared. The shape stays the same, just transformed into the frequency domain. The Gaussian is one of the few functions that’s unchanged, except for scaling — we say it’s self-Fourier.\n\nNext, let’s consider a constant function — just a flat value c across time. Now, technically this function is not square-integrable, meaning we can’t just apply the Fourier transform in the usual way. But in a generalized sense, we can still assign it a meaning. And it turns out the Fourier transform of a constant is a scaled delta function — specifically, c times delta of u. This makes intuitive sense: a constant signal has no frequency variation, so all its energy is concentrated at zero frequency.\n\nAnd finally, look at this interesting example: the shifted delta function delta of t minus a. If you perform the Fourier transform of this, you get a complex exponential — e to the power minus i 2 pi a u. This tells us that shifting a delta function in time introduces a phase shift in frequency. And that phase shift depends on the amount of translation — the value a — and also on the frequency u.\n\nNow, I should point out — when you’re working with generalized functions like constants and delta functions, the usual rules don’t always apply directly. These are not square-integrable functions. So we use the tools of distribution theory to handle them more rigorously. If you’re curious, I explain this in more detail in the book chapter.\n\nBut for now, just keep in mind — even with these edge cases, the idea of expressing a signal in terms of wave components still holds.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

If you combine two functions, say f and g, using constants a and b — meaning you form \"a times f plus b times g\" — then the Fourier transform of that sum is simply \"a times the transform of f plus b times the transform of g.\" This reflects the principle of superposition, which is central to all linear systems.\n\nNext is the time-shifting property. If you shift a function in time — let’s say you move it by x naught — then in the frequency domain, the transform stays the same in shape but gets multiplied by a complex exponential factor. Specifically, it’s multiplied by e to the power minus i 2 pi x naught u. So shifting in time introduces a phase shift in frequency.\n\nNow let’s flip that idea — this is called modulation. If you multiply a function in the time domain by a complex exponential, then you shift its frequency content. So time-domain modulation causes a translation in the frequency domain.\n\nAnother important concept is scaling. If you compress or stretch a function in time — say, you use f of a t — then the frequency representation stretches or compresses in the opposite way. And the result is scaled by one over the absolute value of a. So if the time signal gets narrower, the spectrum spreads out.\n\nWe also have conjugation. If you take the complex conjugate of a function, then its Fourier transform reflects across the frequency axis — that is, the transform at minus u becomes the conjugate of the transform at u.\nAnd finally, if the original function is real-valued, its Fourier transform has Hermitian symmetry. That means the spectrum is symmetric in a complex-conjugate sense.\n\nEach of these properties gives us deeper insight into how signals behave across time and frequency. We’ll explore them in more detail as we continue — but for now, keep these tools in mind. They’ll help you decode and design systems with much greater clarity.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

The result is the same as the summation of the Fourier transformation of f and the Fourier transformation of g. So this is additivity. So in the system, linear system lecture, we explain that. \n\nHow about the scaling or homogeneity? So if f is scaled by alpha, then we perform Fourier transform. That's the same as performing the Fourier transform of f. Then you scale the result by the same scaling factor.

Suppose we have a function, f of t, and we shift it by some constant b. That means our new function is f of t minus b. So what happens to its Fourier transform?\nThe answer is: the shape of the spectrum stays the same, but we multiply it by a phase factor. Specifically, we multiply it by e to the power minus 2 pi i s b. In other words, shifting the function in time causes a rotation in the phase of the frequency spectrum.\n\nLet’s go through why that’s true.\nWe start with the definition of the Fourier transform of f of t minus b. Inside the integral, we make a substitution: we let u equal t minus b. That’s just a change of variable — and it doesn’t affect the limits of the integral, which still go from negative infinity to positive infinity.\n\nNow, when we rewrite the integral in terms of u, something interesting happens. The exponential term splits into two parts. One part depends on u, and the other depends on b. The part with b is just a constant, so we can pull it outside the integral.\nWhat remains inside is the same integral we started with — the Fourier transform of the original function, f of t.\nSo in the end, we have the original spectrum, multiplied by this exponential phase term.\n\nThat’s the core idea of the shift property:\u000bWhen you shift a function in time, it introduces a phase shift in the frequency domain.\nThis is an extremely useful result when working with signals that are delayed or moved in time — it tells you exactly how the spectrum changes, and helps preserve the full mathematical relationship between time and frequency.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

What’s the reasoning behind it?\nSo far, we've seen that the Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions — say, f of t and g of t — turns into a simple multiplication of their individual transforms. \n\nBut why is that true?\nLet’s walk through the logic behind it, one step at a time.\nWe start with this:\u000bMultiply the Fourier transform of f of t by the Fourier transform of g of t. That means you're multiplying two integrals. One for g of t times a complex exponential, and the other for f of x times the same kind of exponential — but with a different variable.\nTo combine them, we use different dummy variables inside the integrals — like t in one and x in the other — so they don't interfere. Then we combine them into a double integral.\n\nNow we group the exponential terms. The two exponentials become a single exponential with t plus x in the exponent.\nThis sets up our key trick: we change variables. In the inner integral, let’s say\u000bu equals t plus x. That means t equals u minus x, and since we're just changing variables inside an integral, the limits stay the same.\nSo now, what used to be g of t becomes g of u minus x, and the exponential becomes a function of u. This lets us express the entire inside of the integral in terms of u, and f of x stays outside.\nAt this point, we switch the order of integration — that’s allowed because the functions we’re working with are well-behaved. So now we’re integrating over u, with x nested inside.\n\nWhat you get in the end is this:\u000bYou have e to the power minus 2 pi i s  u — that’s the same complex exponential from the Fourier formula — and it’s multiplied by the convolution of g and f at position u.\nThat’s the key. The inner integral has now become the convolution of g and f, evaluated at u.\nSo finally, this whole thing is just the Fourier transform of that convolution.\nThat’s the magic of it.\u000b\nMultiplication in the Fourier domain really does correspond to convolution in the time domain — and now you’ve seen where it comes from.\nOf course, these steps are dense, and I encourage you to go over them again slowly.

If you feed a sinusoidal signal into such a system, the output will also be sinusoidal. And—here’s the key—it will be at the same frequency. The system might change the amplitude or the phase, but it doesn’t generate new frequencies. That’s the hallmark of a shift-invariant, or time-invariant, linear system.\nThis leads to a deep and beautiful conclusion. If sinusoidal signals are preserved in shape and frequency, then the effect of the system on each frequency component can be described by a single number—just a scaling factor that depends on frequency.\n\nSo, imagine you take any general signal, and you decompose it into a sum of sinusoidal components. The system acts on each component individually, scaling each one by a different amount. That’s exactly what multiplication looks like in the Fourier domain. Each frequency is being multiplied by its own gain factor.\nThat’s why convolution in the time domain turns into multiplication in the frequency domain.\n\nNow, here's something important: this only works because of that special property of sinusoids. Among all functions, only sinusoids maintain their shape when passing through a shift-invariant linear system. Delta functions, for instance, don’t behave that way—they get transformed into something entirely different. But a cosine remains a cosine. A sine remains a sine. Just possibly scaled or phase-shifted.\nAnd this is what makes the Fourier transform so unique. It’s the only transform for which the convolution theorem holds—because only sinusoids have this invariance.\n\nYou might wonder—could we define a similar convolution theorem using other transforms, like wavelet transforms or Hadamard transforms? The answer is no. Those basis functions don’t have this shape-preserving property under linear shift-invariant systems. So the convolution theorem doesn’t hold for them.\n\nNow if you’re curious, you can actually find some advanced papers on this. Try searching for “characterization of the convolution theorem.” You’ll find rigorous mathematical proofs that ultimately say the same thing: the convolution theorem is special to the Fourier transform.\nBut you don’t need pages of math to get the intuition. If a function keeps its shape through a system, and we can describe the system’s effect with a frequency-dependent multiplier, then that’s multiplication in the Fourier domain.\nAnd if you're passionate about the math behind this, you could even write a short paper exploring this idea. I'd be happy to discuss it with you.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

Mathematically, it's written as:\u000bthe integral of the square of the function f of t over all time, equals the integral of the square of its Fourier transform — f hat of s — over all frequencies.\nLet me give you some intuition here.\n\nSuppose you have a function, maybe it’s an electric signal or a sound wave. In the time domain, the quantity f of t squared represents the power of that signal at each instant. When you integrate this over time, you’re summing up all that power — you get the total energy.\nNow, that same signal can be broken down into its frequency components using the Fourier transform. In that domain, each component has an amplitude, and squaring that amplitude gives you the energy associated with that frequency. Integrating over all frequencies gives you the total energy — again.\n\nSo Parseval’s Identity tells us something very beautiful: energy is conserved between the time domain and the frequency domain.\nThis has a strong connection to what you learned in physics. Think about alternating current. If you have a sinusoidal current flowing through a resistor, the instantaneous power is proportional to the current squared. And when you integrate that over time, you get the total energy consumed by the resistor.\n\nNow, from a geometric perspective, you can think of f of t as a vector in an infinite-dimensional space. That sounds abstract, but it’s just like a regular vector — except with infinitely many components. And the length of this vector is found by summing up the square of each component — just like in ordinary geometry.\n\nThe Fourier transform is a kind of coordinate transformation — like a rotation of the space. So when we go from the time domain to the frequency domain, we’re rotating the vector. But that doesn’t change its length. So geometrically, Parseval’s Identity simply says: the length of the signal vector is preserved under the Fourier transform.\nYou can also prove this identity using standard calculus and the definition of the Fourier transform. And yes, that’s a good exercise. But I want you to also grasp the meaning behind it.\n\nSo next time you see this identity, remember — it’s not just a formula. It tells you that energy, or vector length, is preserved when moving between the time and frequency domains.

Now, suppose we want to express this same point in a new coordinate system, X-prime and Y-prime, which is rotated by some angle phi from the original axes.\nAs the diagram shows, the new coordinates — x-prime and y-prime — can be computed from the original ones using the rotation formulas.\n\nSo x-prime equals x times cosine phi plus y times sine phi,\u000band y-prime equals negative x times sine phi plus y times cosine phi.\nYou can also write this transformation in matrix form.

But instead of waves traveling along a line, now we’re dealing with wave patterns that extend in all directions across a plane.\n\nThe 2D Fourier transform lets us analyze how these wave components — traveling in the x direction, the y direction, or even diagonally — contribute to the overall structure of the signal or image.\nThe formula here tells us how to compute the 2D Fourier transform. The function f of x and y is transformed into capital F of u and v, where u and v represent the spatial frequencies in the horizontal and vertical directions.\nAnd just like before, there’s an inverse formula that lets us go back from the frequency domain to the original spatial domain.\nNow, why is this so useful?\n\nBecause in many real-world applications — like medical imaging, computer vision, or signal processing — we deal with 2D data. Think of an image, for example. Each pixel represents a value at some x and y location. When we apply the 2D Fourier transform, we can analyze the texture, orientation, and frequency content of that image.\n\nOn the left side of the slide, we see a simple geometric object — like a bar. On the right is its 2D Fourier spectrum.

It’s a noisy version of a familiar test image — lots of random graininess, especially in the background and darker areas.\n\nNow, if we perform a 2D Fourier transform — which we indicate here by \"F T\" — we move from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. The result is this bottom-left image, which shows the frequency spectrum of the noisy image.\nNotice something important: most of the meaningful image information is concentrated around the center, which corresponds to the low-frequency components. But the noise is spread out — especially toward the edges — as high-frequency speckles.\nAnd this gives us an idea.\n\nWhat if we simply suppress or remove those high-frequency components? That’s what we’re doing on the bottom-right: we apply a mask — setting the noisy high-frequency regions to zero, while keeping only the central, low-frequency region.\n\nThen we perform the inverse Fourier transform — marked here as \"I F T\" — to convert back to the spatial domain.\nAnd just like that, we get a much cleaner version of the original image. Most of the noise is gone, and the essential structure is preserved.\nThis is one of the key strengths of working in the frequency domain.

Below it, you see the corresponding frequency spectrum. It contains both low-frequency components, which encode smooth variations like brightness and shading, and high-frequency components, which capture edges and fine details.\n\nNow look at the middle column.\nHere, we’ve applied a low-pass filter. That means we kept only the low-frequency components — those near the center of the Fourier spectrum — and removed the rest. You can see the filtered spectrum just below. The result, shown in the middle image above, is a smoothed version of the original — the fine details are gone, and only the broad, soft structures remain.\n\nNext, we move to the rightmost column.\nThis time we’ve done the opposite. We removed the low frequencies and kept only a selected band of high-frequency components. You can see that in the frequency plot — a ring where the center is zeroed out. The corresponding spatial image above now reveals only the edges — the sharp transitions in intensity.\nSo by simply choosing which frequency bands to preserve or remove, we can control the kind of information we keep — soft versus sharp, background versus boundary.\n\nThis is another powerful reason why we often work in the frequency domain — filtering becomes intuitive and flexible.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

But when we take its 2D Fourier transform, something fascinating happens.\nThe resulting function in the frequency domain is a product of two sinc functions — one in the u direction and one in the v direction. And remember, sinc functions come from the Fourier transform of a box function in one dimension. So when we go to two dimensions, the result is just a multiplication of two of them — one along each axis.\n\nYou can see this result visualized in the bottom right. There's a sharp peak in the center — that’s the low-frequency content — and then it decays with oscillations outward, characteristic of sinc behavior.\n\nNow here’s something more interesting: when we move into higher dimensions, something new becomes possible — rotation. In 1D, you can only flip a signal left or right, but there's no true concept of rotation. However, in 2D or 3D, you can rotate the object, and that rotation affects the frequency domain in a meaningful way.\nThis rotational property is one of the key advantages of analyzing signals in higher dimensions. It allows us to understand and manipulate how orientation in space translates into patterns in frequency.\n\nSo this simple example — a rectangular function — gives us a powerful insight into the structure of Fourier transforms in two dimensions.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

That means the structure of the frequency content preserves the orientation of the original signal.\n\nFor instance, if you rotate an image by 30 degrees counterclockwise, the entire frequency spectrum also rotates by 30 degrees counterclockwise. The shape and the distribution of frequencies remain the same, just oriented differently. This behavior is not just limited to 2D — it holds in any number of dimensions.\n\nWhy does this happen? Well, it comes from the mathematics of how the Fourier transform is defined. If we apply a rotation matrix — let’s call it R theta — to the spatial variable, we see that the frequency variable ends up rotated in exactly the same way. It’s a symmetry property built into the transform itself.\n\nNow, the proof is shown here, and you’re welcome to follow through it if you like. It involves a change of variables and some linear algebra, but the takeaway is beautifully simple: rotate the function, and its spectrum rotates too.\nThis rotational invariance is one of the reasons Fourier analysis is so useful in imaging, especially in applications like object detection, texture analysis, and pattern recognition — where orientation should not change the essential features.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 42}

This function has a certain frequency structure, and that’s captured in its Fourier transform, shown to the right.\n\nNow, here’s the key idea: each point in the Fourier spectrum corresponds to a sinusoidal wave component — a wave moving in a specific direction and with a certain frequency. When you sum up all these wave components, you reconstruct the original image.\n\nSo what happens when we rotate the original function? Say we rotate it 45 degrees counterclockwise. Well, to reconstruct this rotated function using the same wave-based approach, each of those original wave components must also rotate by the same 45 degrees. That’s the only way they’ll still combine to match the rotated shape.\n\nAs you can see in the second row, the rotated spatial function leads to a rotated frequency spectrum. Both are rotated by the same angle, preserving the overall structure. This is what we mean by the rotation property of the Fourier transform.\nYou can verify this rigorously with mathematics, but this geometric reasoning gives us an intuitive, visual understanding of what’s happening.\n\nThis is part of a much deeper concept: the duality of information. You can think of an image as made of individual points — pixels or voxels — or as made of sinusoids, each with different directions and frequencies. These two views are completely interchangeable, and Fourier analysis is the bridge between them.\n\nThat’s why this topic is so foundational. It’s not just about imaging.

That symbolizes the delta function, which represents the particle-like, pointwise nature of signals — sharp, localized, discrete. It's our way of representing structure in the spatial or time domain.\n\nNext to it is e to the power i-theta, a complex exponential. This captures the wave nature — smooth, oscillating, continuous. It represents sinusoids, and it's central to how we describe frequency, phase, rotation, and oscilation in the complex plane, describing wave propagation.\n\nSo together, delta and e to the i-theta — one representing particles, the other waves — form a kind of duality. And this duality runs throughout everything we’ve covered: convolution, linear systems, Fourier series, and Fourier transforms.\nThe real power of Fourier analysis is in how it unifies these two views. A signal can be described by where things happen — using delta functions — or by how things oscillate — using sinusoids. This interplay is what makes the field so rich and so widely applicable.\n\nThat’s why I like this little symbol.

It tells us that a function of t — written as f of t — can be expressed as a sum over many terms.\nMathematically, this is written as:\nf of t equals the sum from n equals negative infinity to positive infinity, of c  n times e to the power 2 pi i n t over capital T.\nEach term in the sum is a complex exponential — and each coefficient, c  n, tells us how much of that particular frequency component is present in the signal.\n\nNow how do we calculate these coefficients?\nWe use the formula:\nc  n equals 1 over capital T, times the integral from 0 to capital T, of f of t multiplied by e to the power negative 2 pi i n t over capital T, d t.\nSo what we’re doing here is projecting the function f of t onto a basis function — that basis is the complex exponential. This is very much like taking an inner product between vectors.\n\nYou can think of the function as living in a high-dimensional space — in fact, infinitely many dimensions. Each basis function spans one of those directions. So when we compute c  n, we’re measuring how much f of t points in the direction of that basis function.\nNow, what if the function isn’t periodic, or the period becomes very large?\nThat’s where the Fourier transform comes in.\n\nInstead of summing over discrete frequencies, we move to a continuous frequency variable, often called s.\nThe Fourier transform of f of t is written as f hat of s, and it’s defined as:\nThe integral from negative infinity to positive infinity, of f of t times e to the power negative 2 pi i s t, d t.\nTo recover the original function, we use the inverse Fourier transform, which is:\nf of t equals the integral from negative infinity to positive infinity, of f hat of s times e to the power 2 pi i s t, d s.\n\nSo you can see — when we move from a periodic function with period capital T, to a general function as T approaches infinity, the Fourier series becomes the Fourier transform.\nThis is a very elegant transition — from a discrete sum to a continuous integral — and it forms the basis of much of signal processing.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 47}

Each one looks like a block or a box.\nTo compute the convolution, you flip one function, shift it, multiply the overlapping parts, and add the result.\nWhen the two rectangles perfectly overlap, the area under the curve reaches its maximum. As they move apart, the overlapping area decreases linearly — and what you get is a triangle-shaped function.\nSo, two rectangles convolved give you a triangle.\n\nNow let’s look at this in the frequency domain.\nWe know the Fourier transform of a rectangular function is a sinc function — that’s sinc of s, which comes from sine of pi s over pi s.\nSo when we convolve two rectangles in the time domain, we get a triangle. That means, in the frequency domain, we multiply two sinc functions — and we get sinc squared.\nSo: Triangle in time domain means sinc squared in frequency domain.\n\nThis is a powerful example that helps you visualize the convolution theorem in action.

What makes it so special?\n\nIn the last lecture, I mentioned something that gives us a clue.\u000bIf you have a shift-invariant linear system, and you input a sinusoidal signal, what comes out is also a sinusoid, and — importantly — at the same frequency.\nThat’s a big deal.\nIt means the system doesn't generate any new frequencies. It doesn’t distort the sinusoid into some other shape. It simply scales it or shifts its phase — but the frequency stays the same.\nThis is a unique and powerful property of sinusoids.\n\nNow let’s think about what that means for convolution and Fourier analysis.\nIn time-domain analysis, convolution is the operation that describes how a system responds to an input.\nBut if your input and your system are both described using sinusoids, and those sinusoids don’t change frequency, then it turns out convolution becomes multiplication in the Fourier domain.\n\nWhy?\nBecause in the Fourier domain, every signal is broken into sinusoids. And if each one stays intact — same frequency in, same frequency out — then multiplying their responses is all you need to compute the system output.\nThat’s exactly what the convolution theorem says:\u000bConvolution in time equals multiplication in frequency.\nBut — and this is important — this beautiful relationship only works because of the special behavior of sinusoids.\nIf your input signal isn’t made of sinusoids, or your system doesn’t treat them nicely, this property breaks down.\nThat’s why this theorem only exists for the Fourier transform, which is based entirely on sinusoids.\u000bOther transforms — like wavelets or polynomials — don’t have this same \"in equals out\" behavior, and so they don’t give us a convolution theorem in the same way.\n\nIf you’re curious, I actually encourage you to think about this more. You could even write a short paper or a reflection on it.\nHere’s something to try:\nTry proving that if a function goes into a system and the same form comes out — unchanged except for amplitude and phase — then that function must be a sinusoid.\n\nAnd also prove the related idea:\u000bIf sinusoids go in and come out with the same frequency, then convolution in time must match multiplication in frequency.\nThese are two different ideas — but together, they give us the foundation for the convolution theorem and explain why Fourier analysis is so powerful for linear systems.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 47}

Then, any signal you put into that system just passes through exactly as it is — unchanged. The system does nothing.\u000bThis is an ideal system — it responds instantly and perfectly.\n\nFor example, if a camera had a perfect delta-function impulse response, every point in the scene would be captured exactly — with perfect sharpness, no blur at all.\nBut in real life, that doesn’t happen. No camera has a true delta response.\n\nIn practical systems, the impulse response is not a delta function — it’s more spread out. That means the system blurs things.\u000bEven if you feed it a sharp impulse, the output will be a wider, smeared version — not the same as the input.\nSo what does that mean in the frequency domain?\n\nWell, we know that the Fourier transform of a delta function is a constant — it's just one everywhere.\u000bThat’s because a delta contains all frequencies equally.\nBut if your impulse response is not a delta — if it’s more spread out — then its Fourier transform won’t be constant.\u000bIt will vary in frequency.

For example:\n1 becomes zero one,\n2 becomes one zero,\n3 becomes one one,\nand so on.\nThis is how a continuous analog signal — like sound or temperature — becomes a digital signal inside a computer:\u000bFirst through sampling across time, then through quantization of amplitude, and finally through binary encoding.\n\nEach step introduces a tradeoff:\nMore sampling points give better resolution in time.\nMore quantization levels give better precision in amplitude.\nBut more of both means more data to store and process.\nThis is the foundation of digital signal processing — and now you’ve seen how it all begins.\n\nAnd finally, that digital data — made up of zeros and ones — enters the computer, where it can be displayed, analyzed, stored, or transmitted.\n\nSo again, the pipeline goes like this:\nPhysical system → transducer → signal conditioning → analog-to-digital conversion → computer.\nThis entire process happens in almost every modern system — from medical devices to smart homes to autonomous vehicles.\nAnd the better we understand this chain, the better we can design systems that are accurate, efficient, and reliable.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 47}

If we don’t sample it frequently enough — meaning, we don’t take enough points per second — we miss those small peaks and dips.\nIn the middle, you see the result of sparse sampling.

And when you multiply the continuous signal by this impulse train, the result is a set of discrete values. That’s what you see on the right: only the values of the signal at those impulse positions are preserved — the rest are discarded.\n\nIn the spatial domain, sampling is essentially a point-wise multiplication of the signal with an impulse train.\nAnd here’s the key idea: this operation in the spatial domain has a direct consequence in the frequency domain. Multiplying by an impulse train in space corresponds to replicating the spectrum of the signal — creating a periodic train of delta functions in the frequency domain.\nJust as we observe periodicity in time or space due to regular sampling, we also obtain periodicity in frequency.

These represent the periodic sampling pattern in the time domain.\nWhen we convolve the original spectrum with this delta train, what we get is shown on the right: multiple shifted copies of the original spectrum. One in the center, and others repeated at regular intervals to the left and right. These are called spectral replicas.\n\nNow, this setup is fine if the copies don’t overlap. But in the case shown here, the original spectrum is wide — it spreads across many frequencies — and the spacing between these delta peaks is not large enough. So the replicas overlap, and this overlap is what causes aliasing.\n\nAliasing is when different frequency components get mixed together. It’s like solving the equation x plus y equals 10,  you can't tell how much is x and how much is y. Similarly, when spectra overlap, you lose the ability to tell which part of the signal came from which frequency.

If we want to keep only the part of the spectrum we care about, we can apply a rectangular window — often called a gate function. This simply means we multiply the spectrum by a box that passes certain frequencies and zeros out the rest. Everything outside the band is eliminated.\n\nNow here’s the important part: multiplication in the frequency domain corresponds to convolution in the spatial or time domain. So when we apply this gate in Fourier space, the corresponding operation in the spatial domain is convolution with the inverse Fourier transform of the rectangle. And that inverse transform is something we’ve seen before — it’s the sinc function.\n\nThis sinc function has a sharp central peak and extends out forever with oscillating ripples. We say it has infinite support, and those ripples are often called ringing. So while the ideal filter works perfectly in theory, it’s not so practical in real applications. Why? Because we can’t build something with infinite extent.

You can think of it as performing a moving average across discrete sample points to approximate the original continuous signal.\n\nIt’s a simple, easy-to-implement method — and that’s why we call it \"cheap.\" But here's the tradeoff: it’s far from ideal.\nIn the frequency domain, we’re no longer cleanly cutting off frequencies beyond a certain band. The sinc function doesn’t have sharp boundaries, so it doesn’t isolate frequencies as cleanly as the gate function would.

But the Gaussian stays in the same form, just scaled differently.\nSo, if you multiply by a Gaussian in the frequency domain, that corresponds to convolving with a Gaussian in the spatial or time domain — and vice versa.\n\nWhy is this helpful? Because the Gaussian function decays very quickly. That means we avoid the problem of infinite ringing, like we saw with the sinc function. Instead of having a sharp cutoff, which can cause artifacts, the Gaussian gives a smooth transition and localized effect — both in frequency and in space.\n\nIt's not mathematically perfect, but it’s practical.

Now, let’s look at the actual math behind those ideas — starting with the delta function.\n\nIn signal processing, the delta function plays a key role — especially when we have a series of delta functions lined up at regular intervals. We often call this a comb, because visually, it looks just like the teeth of a hair comb.\nHere’s the key idea.\n\nImagine you have a bunch of delta functions spaced by a fixed time interval, T. We write that as:\u000bs of t equals the sum of delta of t minus n times T.\nNow, when you take the Fourier transform of this comb-shaped signal, something beautiful happens. You get another comb — but this time in the frequency domain.\n\nThere’s a simple rule:\nIf the spacing in time is T,\nThen the spacing in frequency becomes 1 over T.\nThe impulses are still evenly spaced, but now they live in the frequency domain. And their height is scaled by a factor of 1 over T.\nSo this transformation turns one comb into another — just flipped into frequency space, with inverted spacing.\nThis is a fundamental result you’ll see in many signal processing books. Different authors may use different symbols — like f or u for frequency, or j or i in the exponential — but the meaning is the same.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that delta functions are really convenient in Fourier analysis. When you plug a delta function into the Fourier formula, it simplifies easily — because a delta picks out a single point.\nAnd when you shift the delta in time — say, to delta of t minus some value — the result in frequency becomes a complex exponential, like e to the j 2 pi f zero t. That’s thanks to the shift theorem.\n\nSo, the takeaway here is:\u000ba comb of delta functions in time becomes another comb in frequency — just with spacing flipped and amplitude scaled.\nThis sets the stage for understanding how sampling works in both domains.

This is a periodic function, right? It repeats every T. So we can use a Fourier series to represent it.\n\nWe write this function, s T of t, as a sum of delta functions at every multiple of T:\u000bs T of t equals the sum over n of delta of t minus n T.\nNow, since it's periodic, we can also express it as a sum of complex exponentials — that’s what a Fourier series does. So we write:\u000bs T of t equals the sum over n of c n times e to the power j 2 pi n t over T,\u000bwhere c n is the Fourier coefficient.\nTo compute c n, we take the standard approach:\u000bc n equals 1 over T times the integral over one period of s T of t multiplied by e to the power negative j 2 pi n t over T.\nBut here’s the trick — remember that s T of t is a train of delta functions. That means when you integrate, only the delta at t = 0 survives. \n\nThe result is simply:\u000bc n equals 1 over T.\nSo when you plug this back in, your entire Fourier series becomes a sum of complex exponentials, each with coefficient 1 over T.\nNow, there’s a well-known identity:\u000bA sum of complex exponentials with equal spacing and equal weights becomes a train of delta functions in the frequency domain.\n\nSo finally, we can write:\u000bs T of t transforms to (1 over T) times s 1 over T of u.\u000bThat is, the train of impulses in time maps to another train of impulses in frequency, with flipped spacing and scaled amplitude.\nThis is what we call a Fourier pair. A comb in one domain becomes another comb in the other domain — with the spacing inverted and amplitude scaled.\nThis idea is fundamental in signal processing. You’ll see it over and over — whether you’re analyzing sampling, modulation, or reconstruction.\n\nNow, I’ll admit — this version of the derivation is not entirely rigorous. It's a bit hand-wavy. A more precise proof would involve deeper mathematical tools, especially when it comes to convergence. But for our purposes, this intuitive explanation gives you the right picture.\n\nSo just keep this in mind:\u000bA periodic sequence of impulses in time transforms into another periodic sequence in frequency, and the spacing and amplitude follow a simple reciprocal relationship.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 47}

This lives in the time domain. And on the right, we see another train of delta functions — this time in the frequency domain — spaced by one over T.\n\nThis is a classic Fourier pair. When you take the Fourier transform of a periodic train of impulses in time, you get another train of impulses in frequency. And the spacing in the frequency domain is the reciprocal of the spacing in the time domain.\n\nNow, let’s look at the lower pair of plots.\nHere, the red comb has impulses spaced by a small interval, delta t. In that case, the spacing in the frequency domain becomes capital P, which equals one over delta t.\nAgain, we see the same idea — spacing in one domain leads to reciprocal spacing in the other. This reciprocal relationship is a fundamental feature of the Fourier transform.\nThe height or amplitude also changes accordingly. Specifically, when the spacing decreases — say, from T to delta t — the impulses become more densely packed, and the total energy gets spread out more in frequency space. So the amplitudes must be adjusted accordingly to conserve energy.\n\nSo in summary:\u000bA periodic impulse train in time becomes a periodic impulse train in frequency.\u000bThe spacing flips — T becomes 1 over T.\u000bThe amplitudes are scaled appropriately.\nThis relationship is so central to sampling, reconstruction, and many other applications in signal processing.

That’s our original continuous signal, shown over a finite interval, from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2. Our goal is to digitize this — to convert it into a form that we can process on a computer.\nAnd to do that, we take measurements at evenly spaced time intervals. This step is crucial, because without any prior knowledge about the signal, we don't know where we should sample more densely or more sparsely — so we just use uniform sampling.\n\nWe model this sampling process mathematically by multiplying the signal with a train of impulses — those red vertical lines spaced by delta t. This models a measurement being taken at regular intervals — just like a thermometer recording temperature every hour.\n\nWhen we multiply the continuous function by this comb of impulses, we’re essentially pulling out values at those discrete points. The result is a sampled signal, where the values are available only at those locations. That’s what you see in the next plot below — the discrete signal.\n\nNow shift your attention to the right-hand side — to the frequency domain.\nThe original continuous signal, when transformed using the Fourier transform, gives us a spectrum — and here it's shown to be concentrated between minus W and plus W. That’s the bandwidth of the signal — most of its energy lies within that frequency range.\nAnd here’s something interesting: if a signal is limited in time — meaning it's non-zero only within a certain interval — then its Fourier transform will spread out infinitely. But if the time-domain signal is smooth, then the energy in its spectrum decays very fast. So in practice, we can often ignore the tiny tails and just focus on the dominant part within minus W to W.\n\nNow, here comes the key insight.\nWhen we sample the time-domain signal using a comb — a series of impulses spaced by delta t — then in the frequency domain, the Fourier transform becomes a convolution. That convolution replicates the original spectrum at regular intervals — and those intervals are one over delta t, which we denote as capital P.\nSo in the frequency domain, we now have multiple copies of the original spectrum, all spaced by P. These are sometimes called spectral replicas.\n\nAnd here’s the big question: how small should delta t be? Or in other words — how dense should our sampling be — so that these spectral copies don’t overlap?\nBecause if they overlap, we get aliasing, and the original signal can’t be recovered. But if P — that is, one over delta t — is large enough, then these copies stay nicely separated, and we can isolate just one of them to recover the original signal perfectly.\n\nSo in short, if we sample densely enough, we don't lose any information. We can convert a continuous signal to a digital one and then reconstruct it — as if nothing was lost.\nAnd that naturally brings us to the next topic — what is the minimum sampling rate we need to guarantee perfect recovery?\nLet’s take a look.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 47}

But in general, a real-world signal may repeat over a different period — maybe two seconds, or ten seconds, or any value we call capital P.\n\nSo, how do we handle that?\nThe answer is: you simply normalize your time axis. You scale the time so that the function fits into a unit interval. Then you apply the standard Fourier series there.\nOnce you’ve built the series, you can scale it back to its original time frame — from zero to capital P — and you get a Fourier expansion that models the function over its true period.\n\nSo to summarize: the Fourier series has the flexibility to represent any periodic function, no matter what its period is.

The first question we should ask is: how can we estimate the DC term?\n\nRemember, in a Fourier series, the DC component is the constant part of the signal — and mathematically, it’s given by the average value of the function over one full period. So, for a continuous function, that just means integrating from zero to one and dividing by the length of the interval.\n\nNow, in practice, we don't work with continuous signals — we sample them. That means we take a finite number of measurements, evenly spaced across the interval. So how do we estimate the DC component from those samples?\nVery simply: we add up all the sampled values, and then we take the average. That average gives us a good estimate of the DC component — the constant term in the Fourier series. \nSo once we’ve taken care of the DC term, we still need to determine the coefficients for the sine and cosine terms — the oscillating parts of the signal.\n\nLet’s say we want to recover N cosine coefficients and N sine coefficients. That gives us a total of 2 times N unknowns. And to solve for 2N unknowns, we’ll need at least 2N independent equations — meaning 2N sampled values.\nSo the takeaway is this: to fully recover a periodic signal using its Fourier series up to N harmonics, you need at least 2N equally spaced sample points.

This is a common way to write periodic signals, using a mix of sines and cosines.\nBut here’s the neat part: this combination can actually be rewritten as a single sine function — with an amplitude and a phase shift. In other words, we can express it as R sine theta plus alpha, where R is the amplitude and alpha is the phase.\n\nThis identity is not just useful — it’s powerful. It tells us that instead of dealing with two separate unknowns, A and B, we can represent the same information using two different unknowns: R, the amplitude, and alpha, the phase.\nSo nothing is lost — we’re simply transforming the representation. Instead of working in the sine-cosine basis, we switch to amplitude and phase.\n\nIf you're curious about the proof or how this identity works, you can easily find tutorials or short videos online that walk through the steps in detail.\nBut the main takeaway here is: whenever you have a sine and cosine pair, you can always combine them into a single sine with a shifted angle.

Each term looks like this: A n sine of 2 pi nu t plus phi n. Here, A n is the amplitude, phi n is the phase, and nu is the frequency.\n\nSo for each sinusoidal component, we need to determine two unknowns — amplitude and phase. That means, for N such components, we end up with 2N unknowns in total.\n\nNow, here’s the key point. To determine those two unknowns for each sinusoid — amplitude and phase — we need at least two data points per cycle. Think of it like trying to draw a sine wave: if you only know one point, you can’t say much. But with two points, you start to get the shape — its size and where it starts.\n\nSo, for the highest frequency in our signal — which we’ll call nu — we need to sample at least twice per cycle. This leads to the idea of spacing between samples. To avoid missing any important information, the spacing between adjacent samples must be less than or equal to 1 over 2 nu.\n\nIn more familiar terms, that means the sampling rate — measured in samples per second — must be greater than 2 times nu. This is the famous Nyquist sampling rate.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because if we sample below this rate, we risk losing information. Our signal might be distorted or misrepresented — a problem known as aliasing. But if we sample at twice the highest frequency or more, we guarantee that every sinusoidal component is accurately captured.\nSo the Nyquist rate gives us a fundamental guideline: sample fast enough to resolve the highest frequency present in the signal.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 47}

But this only works under certain conditions — particularly, when the sampling rate is high enough to avoid aliasing. That’s what the Nyquist theorem guarantees.\n\nNow, let’s walk through this derivation step by step. It’s a bit more mathematical, but I’ll explain the reasoning behind each part.\n\nWe begin by expressing the function f of t as the inverse Fourier transform of a product — specifically, a low-pass filter in the frequency domain multiplied by a sampled version of the original function’s spectrum. Symbolically, we write:\nf of t equals the inverse Fourier transform of the product of capital Pi  P of u and the convolution of f hat of u with S P of u.\n\nNext, we apply properties of the Fourier transform. We pull out the convolution and apply inverse transforms separately. This leads to:\nf of t equals the inverse transform of Pi  P of u, convolved with the inverse transform of f hat of u multiplied by S  P of u.\nThen, we take this result back to the time domain.\n\nHere’s what we get:\u000bf of t equals P times sinc of pi P t, convolved with f of t times S 1 over P of t.\nThis expression means we’re convolving the sinc function — which comes from the inverse transform of a box function in frequency — with the sampled version of the original function.\n\nAnd from there, we arrive at the reconstruction formula you’ve probably seen before:\nf of t equals the sum over k from minus infinity to infinity of f at k over P times sinc of pi times the quantity t minus k over P over pi times the quantity t minus k over P.\nThis is the classic sinc interpolation formula. It tells us that, under the right sampling conditions — meaning, the sampling rate is at least twice the highest frequency in the signal — the continuous signal can be reconstructed exactly by convolving the samples with the sinc function.\n\nSo in summary: sampling in the time domain corresponds to periodic replication in the frequency domain. When the signal is bandlimited and the sampling rate is high enough, we can perfectly reconstruct it using this formula.\nThis is the core of the sampling theorem.

This is a classic case to build intuition around how the Fourier transform behaves in two dimensions.\n\nImagine a rectangle that’s centered at the origin. It has a total width of capital X along the x-axis, and a total height of capital Y along the y-axis. The function value is constant — say, equal to 1 — inside this rectangle, and zero outside.\n\nWe now take the 2D Fourier transform of this rectangle. The formula looks a bit dense, but the steps are straightforward.\n\nWe start with the double integral of the original function times the complex exponential — e to the power minus j 2 pi times the quantity u x plus v y. That’s the standard definition of the 2D Fourier transform.\nSince the function is separable — meaning it depends independently on x and y — we can break the double integral into two parts:\none over x, and one over y.\nEvaluating each of these integrals separately gives us a product of two expressions.\nEach part turns into a sinc function. In the x-direction, we get sin of pi times X u over pi X u — that’s sinc of pi X u. And in the y-direction, it’s sinc of pi Y v.\n\nSo the full 2D Fourier transform ends up as the product of these two sinc functions — one in the u-direction, and one in the v-direction — scaled by the area of the original rectangle, which is X times Y.\nNow if you look at the plot here, you’ll see a 3D surface that shows the magnitude of the Fourier transform — the peak is at the center, and the ripples decay outward. That shape comes directly from the sinc functions.\n\nWhy are we showing this?\nBecause it mirrors the result we saw earlier: when a rectangular function is defined in one domain — here it’s the spatial domain — its transform becomes a sinc function in the other domain — in this case, the frequency domain.\nThis is closely related to the idea we discussed on the previous slide, where the rectangle — or gate — was in the frequency domain, and its transform was a sinc function in time. Whether you go forward or inverse, the core relationship stays similar.\nSo while this example is technically a bit different — it’s 2D, and it’s a forward transform — the intuition still applies.

This comes from taking the inverse Fourier transform of the rectangular function in the frequency domain — the gate function we introduced earlier. When we take its inverse Fourier transform, we get a sinc function in the time domain. That’s because a rectangle in frequency always corresponds to a sinc in time. So that’s where this sine of pi P t over pi P t comes from — it’s our sinc kernel.\n\nNow, let’s turn to the function inside the brackets.\nHere, we’re performing an inverse Fourier transform on the product of two terms:\nthe Fourier transform of our original function,\nand a periodic impulse train in frequency, with spacing capital P.\nBy the convolution theorem, multiplying two functions in the frequency domain is equivalent to convolving their inverse transforms in the time domain. So we convolve the original function f of t with the inverse transform of this impulse train in the frequency domain.\n\nAnd what is the inverse transform of a periodic impulse train in frequency?\nIt gives us another periodic impulse train — this time in time — with spacing equal to one over capital P. So this entire expression simplifies to f of t convolved with a sum of shifted delta functions, spaced by one over P.\nWe can express that more clearly on the next line. The equation now becomes:\nf of t equals sinc of pi P t multiplied by the sum over all k from minus infinity to infinity of f of t times delta of t minus k over P.\nAnd because convolution with a delta function simply samples the function, this expression simplifies further — giving us the familiar formula for signal reconstruction.\n\nSo finally, we arrive at the last equation on this slide:\nf of t equals the sum over k, from negative to positive infinity,\u000bof f evaluated at k over P,\u000btimes sinc of pi times the quantity t minus k over P.\nThis is the reconstruction formula for band-limited signals. It tells us that if the signal was sampled at or above the Nyquist rate — meaning no aliasing occurred — then we can recover the original continuous function perfectly by summing shifted sinc functions, each scaled by the sampled value.\n\nThat’s the power of the sampling theorem. It doesn’t just allow us to digitize signals — it tells us exactly how to recover them.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 47}

It says:\ns of t equals the sum over all n of delta of t minus n times capital T.\nThis is what we call a delta train or comb function in the time domain. It’s a series of impulses, evenly spaced by T units.\nNow, when we take the Fourier transform of this comb, something very elegant happens.\nIt becomes another comb — but in the frequency domain.\n\nSpecifically, the transform is:\ns of f equals one over capital T times the sum over all n of delta of f minus n over capital T.\nSo, in words, a comb in time with spacing T becomes a comb in frequency with spacing 1 over T. And we get a scaling factor of 1 over T in front.\nThis is a fundamental symmetry in Fourier analysis: when a signal is periodic in time, its spectrum is discrete in frequency — and vice versa.\n\nNow look at the plots in the middle of the slide.\nOn the left side, we see a train of impulses spaced T apart along the time axis. On the right, we have the corresponding Fourier transform — another train of impulses but now spaced 1 over T along the frequency axis.\nSo there’s this beautiful reciprocal relationship: if your delta train is spaced T in time, its Fourier counterpart is spaced 1 over T in frequency.\nAnd this brings us to the red box at the bottom of the slide. These equations generalize the idea.\n\nLet’s say you have a sum of delta functions shifted by n over P. That’s a comb with spacing 1 over P.\nThen, its Fourier transform becomes P times a sum of delta functions spaced P apart. The scaling factor flips — one becomes P, and the spacing flips from 1 over P to P.\nAnd if we put a scaling factor of 1 over P in front of the comb, then the Fourier transform is simply a comb with spacing P, with no extra scaling factor.\nSo again, delta trains are their own Fourier transforms — up to a scaling and spacing change.\n\nThis property is essential when we talk about sampling, because whenever we sample a signal, we’re essentially multiplying it by a comb function in time. And that multiplication creates repeated spectra in the frequency domain — spaced according to the sampling rate.\nSo that’s the comb and its mirror — one of the most powerful dualities in Fourier theory.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 47}

That brought us to this expression:\nf of t equals sinc of pi P t, divided by pi P t, convolved with the sum from k equals minus infinity to infinity of f of t times delta of t minus k over P.\nLet’s unpack that.\nFirst, remember that this sum is what we call a delta train — an infinite series of delta functions spaced at intervals of 1 over P.\n\nNow you might ask — wait a minute, where did the 1 over P factor go?\nGood observation.\nOriginally, the delta train had a scaling factor of 1 over P. But earlier in the derivation, we also had a P multiplying the sinc function. So those two terms — P and 1 over P — cancel out. That’s why we don’t see the 1 over P anymore in the final expression.\n\nSo what do we have now?\nWe have a continuous function — that’s the sinc — multiplying a series of impulses that are sampling the original function at regular intervals.\nThis is the essence of the sampling process.\nThe function f of t is being sampled at every t equals k over P, and the result is a series of weighted sinc functions. Each one is centered at t equals k over P and scaled by the corresponding sample value, f of k over P.\nAnd that brings us to the final expression:\nf of t equals the sum from k equals minus infinity to infinity of f of k over P, multiplied by sinc of pi P times t minus k over P, divided by pi P times t minus k over P.\nThat’s the sampling theorem.\n\nIt tells us that if a signal is band-limited — that is, its frequency content is restricted — then we can reconstruct the entire continuous-time signal exactly from its samples, as long as the sampling rate is high enough.\nEach sample contributes a scaled sinc function, and the sum of all those sinc functions reconstructs the original signal.\nThis formula is both elegant and powerful — and it lies at the foundation of all modern digital signal processing.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 47}

In the middle plot, you see a train of delta functions — these are evenly spaced impulses in time.

These are the values of f of t taken at regular intervals — specifically at times k over P. These are the points where our delta functions were placed during sampling.\n\nNow, we take each of those sampled values — each f of k over P — and multiply it by a special function called the sinc function. You can see it written here as sine of pi times P times t minus k over P divided by pi times P times t minus k over P.\nThis sinc function looks like a smooth oscillating wave that decays gradually away from its center. And what’s important is that it has the perfect shape to reconstruct smooth curves from discrete data points.\n\nNow here’s the key idea.\nEach sampled value acts like a weight, and each weight generates a shifted copy of the sinc function centered at that sample point. So at k over P, we get a sinc function that peaks there, scaled by the sample value at that point.\nThen we add up all these sinc functions — one for each sample.\n\nThe result? A continuous, smooth signal — which is exactly the original signal f of t that we started with.\nThis is how sampling and reconstruction come together. Each delta function \"copies\" the sinc function. Each copy is scaled by the corresponding sample value. And the sum of all these scaled sinc functions recreates the original analog signal.\nSo this final formula — this infinite sum — tells us something remarkable:\nAs long as we sample carefully, we can fully reconstruct a continuous signal from just its discrete samples.\nThat’s the beauty of the sampling theorem.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 47}

It’s a block function centered at zero. Next to it is h of x, which is a train of two delta functions — one at minus a over two and the other at plus a over two. Their amplitudes are scaled by one-half.\n\nNow, when we convolve f of x with h of x, the result — g of x — is essentially just two shifted copies of the original function. Each delta acts like a copying machine, reproducing f of x at the location of the delta. This is a perfect illustration of how convolution with delta functions results in replicated versions of a signal.\n\nNow let’s look at the bottom half of the slide — we’re moving into the frequency domain.\nThe Fourier transform of the original block function, f of x, becomes a smooth sinc-like curve, F of k. The delta train, h of x, transforms into a cosine wave pattern, H of k. And the product in the frequency domain, F of k times H of k, gives us G of k — a modulated version of the original Fourier transform.\nThis shows us that convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain — one of the central results of Fourier theory.\n\nNow, relating this back to the sampling theorem...\nWhen we sample a continuous signal, we are essentially multiplying it by a train of delta functions. In the time domain, this multiplication picks out the values at those sampling points. But in the frequency domain, it leads to repetitions — or aliases — of the original spectrum.\nAnd when we reconstruct, we don't use the simple rectangle anymore — instead, we use the sinc function, which is the Fourier transform of an ideal low-pass filter. But the principle is the same: the delta functions trigger copies, and these copies are scaled by the actual sample values — f of k over P.\n\nAnd here’s the key takeaway:\nIf we sample fast enough — meaning at more than twice the highest frequency in the original signal — and if the signal is band-limited, then all those sinc functions will line up perfectly, and we can fully recover the original signal.\nThat’s the heart of the sampling theorem. It’s not just an abstract formula — it’s a practical method that allows us to move between continuous and digital signals with full confidence.\n\nThis slide beautifully summarizes the theory.

We no longer assume that a signal is densely sampled or has energy spread all over. Instead, we often find that signals have a sparse structure, especially when we represent them in a suitable basis, like wavelets or gradients.\n\nNow, here’s where it gets really interesting — and this is where modern theory breaks free from traditional Nyquist sampling.\nInstead of sampling a signal very densely — at twice its maximum frequency — we can sample much more sparsely, and still recover the full signal.\n\nHow?\nWe change our assumption.\u000bInstead of assuming the signal is band-limited, we assume it's sparse in some transform domain. Maybe it's sparse in the wavelet domain, or maybe the total variation is small — meaning the signal changes smoothly, or only has a few sharp transitions.\nThen, among all possible solutions that match the measurements, we choose the sparsest one.\n\nThis is the idea behind compressed sensing, and it has revolutionized the way we think about sampling and recovery.\nSo that green button on the slide — it’s there to say: pause and think.

Just follow the intuition.\n\nTraditionally, signal processing has focused on signals that are band-limited — which means their frequencies don’t go beyond a certain point. Based on that assumption, we rely on Nyquist sampling: sample at least twice the maximum frequency, and you can perfectly reconstruct the signal.\n\nBut what if we go beyond that assumption?\nModern theory says: you don’t always need to sample that densely. Instead of requiring a signal to be band-limited, we assume that it’s sparse in some domain. That means — in the right representation, most of the values are zero, or nearly zero.\nThink about images. They may look complex, but when you apply a wavelet transform — like the ones shown in the graphics — most of the wavelet coefficients are close to zero. Only a few carry meaningful information. This is sparsity.\nOn the left, we have an illustration from the book Wavelets in Physics. It shows how signals in physics often exhibit localized spikes — sparse behavior. In the center and top-right, you see surfaces where most values are flat or close to zero, with just a few sharp peaks — again, sparse structure.\n\nEven in biology — like the cellular structure of a leaf — patterns emerge that are spatially compact and repeated. This biological system, shown on the right, is highly structured and organized. And this kind of structure is often sparse when expressed in the right basis.\n\nNow, here’s why sparsity matters.\nIf you don’t have enough measurements to fully determine a signal — that is, if your system is underdetermined — then infinitely many solutions could explain the data. But if you know the signal is sparse, you can ask: among all possible solutions, which one is the sparsest?\nThat’s the central idea behind compressed sensing.\nBy assuming sparsity, and by choosing the solution with the fewest nonzero components, you can accurately recover the original signal — even from very limited data.\n\nSo this concept — sparsity — is not just a mathematical trick. It’s something we see everywhere: in physics, in images, in biology, and in many natural and engineered systems.

On the right, we see its frequency content, also confined to a certain bandwidth.\n\nNow, as we go down the slide, we perform sampling in time. That’s the red comb of vertical lines. We're picking values from the original signal at regular intervals — let’s say every delta t.\nWhat does this do in the frequency domain?\nIt creates multiple copies of the spectrum, repeated again and again. This is called spectral replication.

By now, you should have a clear idea of why, under certain conditions, we can perfectly recover a continuous signal from its sampled version.\n\nHere’s the key idea:\u000bWe start with a continuous signal, f of t, shown here. When we sample it at regular time intervals — let's call that interval delta-t — we obtain a discrete sequence of values. The sampling theorem tells us that, if certain conditions are met, we can reconstruct the original continuous signal from these samples without losing any information.\n\nThat’s remarkable — because even though we only record values at specific time points, and there’s “missing” information in between, the theorem guarantees perfect recovery. But this only works if the original signal’s Fourier transform is band-limited. That means its frequency spectrum is essentially zero outside a certain range, from minus w to plus w.\n\nIn the frequency domain, sampling corresponds to a convolution between the original continuous Fourier spectrum and a periodic train of delta functions. This delta train in frequency comes from the Fourier transform of the impulse train in time. The spacing between the deltas in frequency — which we’ll call P — is the reciprocal of the sampling interval delta-t.\n\nTo avoid any distortion, P must be at least 2 W. This ensures there is no overlap between the repeated copies of the spectrum in the frequency domain. You can think of each delta function as a “copying machine” — each one shifts and reproduces the original spectrum at regular intervals. If the copies don’t overlap, the original information is preserved perfectly.\n\nIn practice, we can apply a low-pass filter to keep only the central copy of the spectrum, then perform an inverse Fourier transform to reconstruct the exact original signal.\n\nNow, a small note about the special case where P equals exactly 2 W: here, the copies just touch at a single point. This doesn’t cause problems unless that single point is a delta function with a finite value — in which case it could contribute to the result. But in most practical signals, that single point has no significant effect.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

That means it completes exactly one cycle in one second. In the frequency domain, this is a band-limited signal — its maximum frequency is 1 hertz.\nIf we sample at exactly twice that frequency — so at 2 hertz — we meet the Nyquist rate exactly. In this case, we take two samples within each cycle. For a pure sinusoid, two unknowns fully describe it: the amplitude and the phase. In theory, two samples per cycle should be enough to determine those two unknowns.\n\nHowever, here’s the problem. Depending on where the samples fall, we might end up with the exact same sample value each time — for example, always sampling at the zero crossings of the sine wave. In that case, all our samples would be zero, and we would have no reliable way to determine the original signal.\n\nIn the Fourier domain, a pure sine wave corresponds to a pair of delta functions located at its positive and negative frequency components. When we sample at exactly 2 w, the duplicated spectra in the frequency domain just touch each other. If the touching points happen to be delta functions, those deltas overlap, and we can no longer separate the contributions from each one. Mathematically, it’s like having the equation X plus Y equals C — you know the sum, but not the individual values. This is an aliasing problem.\n\nThat’s why, in practice, sampling exactly at 2 w is risky. To be safe, we require PPP — the spacing between repeated spectra in frequency — to be slightly greater than 2 w. In other words, the sampling rate should be a little higher than twice the maximum frequency in the signal.

These are the important turning points in the math — the places where something key happens. In a detailed lecture, we would walk through each of them slowly, but here, I want to focus on the big picture.\nWe start in the frequency domain, where the spectrum of our signal is multiplied by a periodic train of impulses. When we bring this back to the time domain, that multiplication turns into a convolution. The result of that convolution involves a special function called “sinc,” which naturally appears when you take the Fourier transform of a rectangular shape in frequency.\n\nNext, when we write out the convolution, we see it as an infinite sum — a series of shifted sinc functions. Each one is scaled by the value of our signal at a sample point. The distance between these samples is delta-t, and that’s simply one over P, the spacing in the frequency domain.\n\nThe final line is the famous Shannon interpolation formula. In words, it says: take each sample of your signal, put a sinc function centered at that sample, scale it by the sample’s value, and then add them all together. Do this for every sample — stretching infinitely in both directions — and you get your original continuous signal back exactly, as long as the sampling conditions are satisfied.\n\nThis is a beautiful result.

They match so perfectly that you can’t even see the difference.\n\nThis is the sampling theorem in action. For band-limited signals, as long as we sample fast enough, we can go back and forth between continuous and discrete forms without losing information.

But between the sample points, the red curve drifts far away from the true black signal.\n\nThis mismatch is caused by aliasing. Because our sampling rate is less than twice the maximum frequency in the signal, the repeated spectra in the frequency domain overlap. That overlap distorts the information, and once it happens, no amount of interpolation can recover the original shape.\n\nSo, while the reconstruction looks fine exactly at the sampled points, the continuous waveform in between is completely wrong.

If the sampling theorem is satisfied, this step causes no information loss.\nBut the story doesn’t end there. Even though our signal is now discrete in time, its Fourier spectrum is still continuous. And a continuous spectrum cannot be stored directly in a computer either.\n\nThat’s where the second part comes in — discretizing the spectrum. This is the central topic of this lecture. The idea is to take the continuous Fourier spectrum and multiply it by a periodic train of delta functions in the frequency domain. This multiplication in frequency corresponds to convolution in the time domain, which effectively copies our time-domain signal over and over again, spaced apart by a fixed period t.\n\nIn other words, sampling in one domain causes repetition — or duplication — in the other domain. When we discretize both the time-domain signal and the frequency-domain spectrum, we end up with a periodic structure in both domains.\nThe key point here is that now, both our signal in time and its spectrum in frequency are discrete and periodic.

This is defined for every value of x and could represent anything — a sound wave, an image profile, or a measured signal.\n\nNext, we have what’s called a Shah function, or an impulse train. This is simply a series of delta functions, each spaced t units apart. Mathematically, it’s written as the sum of delta functions, where each one is located at x equals n T, with n being an integer. You can think of this impulse train as a ruler that marks the exact points where we’ll take our samples.\n\nWhen we multiply the continuous signal f of x by this impulse train, we get the sampled function. This multiplication is done point-by-point: at each delta function’s location, we keep the value of f of x; everywhere else, the result is zero.\nSo the sampled signal is really the original signal’s values, “attached” to the impulses in the train. The impulses mark the positions, and the heights of the impulses carry the signal’s values at those positions.\n\nIn other words, the sampled function is just the original function, but only at discrete, regularly spaced points.

Here, u represents frequency, and u-max is the highest frequency present in the signal — its bandwidth.\nWhen we multiply our signal in time by an impulse train — a set of regularly spaced spikes — that multiplication turns into a convolution in frequency. The result is that the original spectrum gets repeated again and again, spaced apart by the sampling frequency.\n\nIn this diagram, the middle shape is the original spectrum. To the left and right, you can see identical copies. The spacing between them is one over capital T, where capital T is the sampling interval in time.\nIf our sampling frequency — which is one over T — is at least twice the maximum frequency in the signal, then these repeated copies don’t touch each other. In that case, we can simply keep the central copy and reconstruct the original signal perfectly.\n\nBut if we sample too slowly, the copies overlap.

This is aliasing — and once it occurs, we can’t tell which part of the spectrum came from the original signal and which part came from the overlap.\n\nTo avoid aliasing, we must make sure that the highest frequency in the signal — we call it u-max — is less than one divided by twice the sampling interval. In spoken terms, the sampling frequency must be greater than twice u-max. This threshold is called the Nyquist frequency.\n\nWhen the condition is satisfied, we can use a rectangular filter — often called a gate function — to select just the central copy of the spectrum.

That means many different combinations of blue and red could produce the exact same total.\n\nIn other words, you can’t tell exactly how much came from the blue curve and how much came from the red one.

To do that, we multiply the spectrum by a periodic train of impulses — shown here in green. This is just like what we did before in the time domain, but now we’re applying it in the frequency domain.\nMultiplication in the frequency domain corresponds to convolution in the time domain. So, when we apply this green impulse train to the spectrum, the effect in the time domain is that our discrete signal gets duplicated at regular intervals, spaced by capital T.\nHere, delta-u — the spacing between impulses in the frequency domain — equals one over capital T, where capital T is the period of each repeated signal in the time domain.\n\nAs before, we must choose our frequency-domain sampling rate carefully.

Our goal is to sample both the time domain and the frequency domain in a way that makes sense for digital processing.\n\nFirst, let’s ask: how many samples will we have in the time domain?\nThis depends on two things:\nThe sampling interval in time, delta-t. This is equal to one over capital P, where capital P is the spacing in the frequency domain. The smaller the delta-t, the more data points we collect.\nThe total duration of the signal, capital T. The longer we record, the more samples we have.\nThe total number of samples in the time domain — call it N — is simply the total duration T divided by delta-t. Since delta-t is one over P.\n\nWe can write:\u000bN equals T multiplied by P.\nNow let’s switch to the frequency domain.\nHere, the total span of one period in frequency is capital P. The sampling interval in frequency, delta-u, is equal to one over capital T. So the total number of samples in frequency over one period — call it M — is the total span P divided by delta-u. That’s again P multiplied by T.\nThis symmetry is important:\u000bThe number of data points in the time domain and the number of data points in the frequency domain are the same — both equal to P multiplied by T.\n\nSo whether we’re sampling in time or in frequency, the total number of samples is determined by the product of the total span in one domain and the sampling density in the other.\n\nThis is the balanced relationship that underlies the discrete Fourier transform, and it’s why we can move between time and frequency representations so efficiently in digital signal processing.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

We call this number M, and here P is the total span of one period in frequency, while T controls the sampling density in frequency.\n\nIf we take the reciprocal of N, we get a very useful relationship:\u000b1 over N equals delta-t times delta-u,\u000bwhere delta-t is the sampling step size in time, and delta-u is the sampling step size in frequency.\nThis is an expression of the duality between time and frequency. If we fix the total number of samples N, making delta-t smaller — meaning we sample more finely in time — will make delta-u larger, meaning the frequency samples are spaced farther apart. And the reverse is also true.\n\nIn simple terms: if you zoom in more on one domain, you automatically zoom out in the other.

Instead, it becomes the product of the original signal and a series of equally spaced spikes — what we call delta functions. These spikes occur at time intervals of delta-t, which means each spike is separated by one divided by capital P in time. In other words, we only keep the signal’s value at these regular time points, and everywhere else is zero.\n\nWe can describe this mathematically as a sum of delta spikes. Each spike occurs at a time equal to n divided by P, where n goes from zero up to N minus one. The height of each spike is simply the value of the original signal at that time. You can imagine it as a row of vertical lines, each carrying the amplitude of the signal at its sampling point.\nThis gives us the discrete version of the signal in the time domain. Even though it’s just a set of separate values, it still represents a function of time, so we can take its Fourier transform.\n\nWhen we do that, the Fourier transform turns into a sum over all the sampled points. The oscillating factor — what we call the kernel — still has the form “e to the power of minus j times two-pi times the frequency u times n divided by P,” but now we only evaluate it at those sampled time points.\n\nThe outcome is what we call the direct Fourier transform of the sampled signal.

Whether we have just one frequency or many, the result will still be periodic.\n\nNow, in this expression at the top, the left-hand side shows the Fourier series in the time domain, with terms involving t over capital T. On the right-hand side, we have an almost identical formula — but here the variable t has been replaced by u, and T has been replaced by P.

In the time domain, we can picture our original continuous function as being approximated by a collection of rectangles — each rectangle has a height equal to the sample value f of n , and a width of delta-t.\nLikewise, in the frequency domain, the Fourier spectrum is also represented as a collection of rectangles — each one has a height equal to f-hat of m  and a width of delta-u.\n\nWhen we go from the spectrum back to the signal, we’re essentially adding up all of these little rectangular pieces. The factor of delta-t times delta-u captures the combined effect of this discretization in both domains.

The inverse transform simply rotates them back.\n\nThis idea generalizes. In one dimension, the Fourier basis is just sines and cosines. But in two or three dimensions, or on a sphere, we can define more complex sinusoidal patterns, called harmonics. On a sphere, these are the spherical harmonics — each one corresponding to a certain “frequency” pattern over the surface.\n\nThe key property is the same: if you take two different harmonics and compute their inner product, the result is zero — they are orthogonal. If you take one harmonic and do an inner product with itself, you get one — it’s normalized.\nSo whether we are talking about simple sines and cosines, or more complex spherical harmonics, the Fourier transform is still just expressing a signal in terms of an orthogonal set of basis functions, then rotating between these bases.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

It was published by Cooley and Tukey in 1965, and it completely changed the way we do signal processing.\n\nTo give you an idea of its impact, in 1969, analyzing 2,048 data points from a seismic trace using the standard DFT took more than 13 hours. Using the FFT on the exact same machine, the same analysis took just 2.4 seconds. That’s an enormous improvement.\nI remember when I was in primary school, a 2,000-point seismic data analysis could take more than a full day to process. But with FFT, the same task could be finished in under three seconds.\n\nThis kind of speedup is critical in many applications, especially those that need real-time results — whether it’s analyzing signals from an airplane’s sensors, monitoring seismic activity, or performing real-time image reconstruction.\nThe reason FFT is so powerful is that it reduces the computational complexity.\n\nA naive DFT requires about N-squared operations — that’s N multiplications and additions for each of the N outputs.\nThe FFT reduces this to N times log-base-2 of N operations.\nThat’s a huge difference. For example, if N is 1,000, the log-base-2 of N is about 10. So instead of doing a million operations, we only need about ten thousand. The larger N gets, the more dramatic the savings become.\n\nBecause of this efficiency, FFT still plays an essential role in modern signal processing, and it’s also widely used in areas like medical imaging, machine learning, and convolution-based computations.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

This is called the inverse FFT, or IFFT.\n\nIn MATLAB, the fft function computes the forward FFT, and the ifft function computes the inverse FFT. For example, fft of X, N computes an N-point FFT. If the vector X has fewer than N points, it pads with zeros; if it has more, it truncates. The IFFT works the same way, just in reverse.\n\nIf we were to implement the Fourier transform exactly as in the mathematical definition, we would do a summation for each frequency index k. Each summation is essentially an inner product — it requires N multiplications and N additions. And we need to do this for each of the N output points. That’s N times N operations — N squared in total.\nThe FFT and IFFT are like built-in shortcuts. You don’t need to know all the details of how they work to use them — just like you don’t need to know how your phone connects to your friend when you press the call button. You can treat FFT and IFFT as black boxes: you give them the data, and they give you the result quickly and efficiently.\n\nWith FFT and IFFT, Fourier analysis becomes practical for real-time work.

You take one sequence, flip it, shift it, multiply corresponding terms, and sum them up. Then you repeat for each shift. This gives the convolution directly in the time domain.\nIf the first sequence has length n and the second has length m, the convolution result has n plus m minus 1 points. That’s how many shifts we need to perform. And in terms of computation, this direct method takes time proportional to n squares, where n is roughly the size of the data.\nBut there’s a much faster, indirect method. Instead of doing the convolution directly in the time domain, we switch to the frequency domain using the FFT.\n\nHere’s the MATLAB approach:\nFirst, compute the FFT of x — that gives us its frequency spectrum.\nThen, compute the FFT of y — the spectrum of the filter or second sequence.\nIn the frequency domain, convolution turns into multiplication. So we simply multiply the two spectra, element by element.\nFinally, apply the inverse FFT to that product to return to the time domain.\nThis works because of the convolution theorem — it says convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain.\nIf you compare the results from the direct method and the FFT-based method in MATLAB, you’ll see they match exactly. The key difference is efficiency:\n\nDirect convolution: about N square operations.\nFFT-based convolution: about n log n operations — much faster for large n.\nOne small detail: in discrete Fourier analysis, both the time domain and the frequency domain are treated as periodic.

Why?\nIt comes down to the fact that in discrete Fourier analysis, our signals are treated as periodic, not single, isolated sequences, but infinitely repeated copies.\nImagine x as one segment in time, and y as another. In the continuous world, when we shift one relative to the other, we only overlap the part that exists in the original copy. But in the discrete Fourier model, when you shift, parts of one copy can wrap around and overlap with the start of the other copy.\nIt’s as if your “neighbor” signal is spilling into your yard — and at the same time, you’re spilling into your other neighbor’s yard on the left.\n\nThat wrap-around interaction is exactly what circular convolution means:\nThe signals are treated as if arranged around a circle.\nWhen you slide one past the end, it reappears at the other side.\nThe FFT-based convolution performs this circular convolution by default, which is why the result here doesn’t match the direct, linear convolution.\nLater, we’ll see how to avoid this wrap-around effect so the FFT method matches the true linear convolution.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

That’s what zero padding does.\nWe take our original signals and append enough zeros to both so that the total length is at least N plus M minus 1, where N and M are the original lengths of the two sequences.\nIn this example, each signal is only 5 samples long, but we pad them out to length 16. Now, when we perform the FFT, multiply in the frequency domain, and take the inverse FFT, the “wrap-around” region is all zeros — so the result matches the direct, linear convolution exactly.\n\nIn other words, zero padding is like making your yard so wide that your neighbors are too far away to cause any trouble.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

This pushes the neighboring copies farther apart, so when we perform the convolution, only the single red copy and the single blue copy overlap. The neighbors never get close enough to contribute.\nThe result is that our circular convolution now matches the linear convolution exactly — because there’s no wrap-around.

We are on schedule, so no problem.\n\nLet me briefly walk you through the big picture again.\nA linear system is one where we can predict the output for any input by combining the system’s response to simple building blocks. Convolution is the tool that allows us to do exactly that — it takes the input signal and the system’s impulse response, and combines them to give the output.\nThe Fourier series is another powerful idea. It tells us that any periodic signal can be written as a sum of sine and cosine waves. If we make the period infinitely long, this naturally becomes the Fourier transform, which works for non-periodic signals.\n\nBut computers don’t deal with continuous signals. We must first discretize them — that is, represent them as sequences of numbers. This involves sampling in time, and sometimes quantizing amplitudes. The sampling theorem assures us that, if we sample fast enough — at least twice the highest frequency in the signal — we can reconstruct the original waveform perfectly under ideal conditions.\nOnce we sample in time, something interesting happens in the frequency domain: the spectrum becomes periodic. This leads us to the discrete Fourier transform. And if we compute it efficiently, we use the fast Fourier transform, or FFT.\nThese tools are not just theory. They are powerful methods for denoising signals, extracting features, and understanding system behavior. But please remember — typing “fft” in MATLAB is easy; the real value comes from understanding what that result means and why it looks the way it does.\n\nToday, I will guide you through some hands-on MATLAB examples so you can see how Fourier analysis works on discrete data, and how these ideas connect back to the theory we’ve been building.

In some cases, we’re multiplying two signals in the time domain. In others, we’re convolving them. And each time, there’s a matching operation in the frequency domain — because multiplication in one domain corresponds to convolution in the other, and vice versa. This is one of the most important dual relationships in Fourier theory.\n\nYou can also see how different shapes in the time domain create specific patterns in the frequency domain.

The amount of overlap becomes the value of the convolution at that point.\n\nThe picture here shows this idea using two hands. The vertical axis represents flipping, and the horizontal axis represents shifting. You can imagine that at certain positions, the hands align perfectly, giving a large overlap, while at other positions they hardly touch at all, giving a small or zero overlap.\n\nThis is exactly what happens in math: convolution measures the similarity between a signal and a shifted, flipped version of another signal.

This part matches the original linear convolution result and is what we actually want.\n\nThe lesson here is important: to avoid these unwanted overlaps in circular convolution, we often use zero-padding — adding extra zeros to the signals before performing the convolution. This ensures that the result matches the true linear convolution without distortion at the edges.\nWe’ll explore this zero-padding step in detail in a few slides, and you’ll see how MATLAB handles it.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 29}

So instead of one top hand, we now have several copies in a row, as shown here with three hands.\nWhen we slide the lower signal, we can’t “run out” of data on either end, because the pattern simply wraps around.

First, we take the FFT of our two sequences, x and h. Then, we multiply their spectra point by point. Finally, we take the inverse FFT to bring the result back into the time domain.\nMathematically, multiplication in the frequency domain is equivalent to convolution in the time domain — but here’s the key point: if we don’t use zero-padding, the convolution we get is circular by nature.\nIn the plot below, the blue curve is the circular convolution result without zero-padding. The red dashed curve is the linear convolution result from our earlier example.\n\nNotice how the blue curve is distorted — it doesn’t match the clean triangular shape of the red curve. That distortion comes from the wrapping-around effect we talked about earlier: parts of the signal from the end are interfering with parts from the beginning.\nThis is why zero-padding is essential when we want the frequency-domain method to give the same result as linear convolution.

On the opposite plate, a positive charge accumulates. Importantly, the capacitor itself doesn’t let electrons pass directly through; instead, the charges stay separated by an insulating material called the dielectric.\nAs more charge accumulates, an opposing electric field develops across the plates. Eventually, this field balances the applied voltage, and the current flow stops.\n\nMathematically, the relationship between voltage and current for a capacitor is given by:\u000bI equals C times the derivative of v with respect to time.\u000bIn words, the current is proportional to how quickly the voltage changes over time.\u000bWe can also write it in integral form:\u000bv equals one over C times the integral of i with respect to time, plus the initial voltage.\n\nThis is different from a resistor, where voltage and current are simply proportional.

We can represent this on a complex plane, with the horizontal axis for the real part and the vertical axis for the imaginary part. This is like a Cartesian coordinate system.\nBut there’s another way to represent the same point — using polar coordinates. Instead of x y, we describe it by its distance from the origin, called the magnitude r, and its angle from the real axis, called the phase angle phi.\n\nMathematically, we can write this as r times e to the power i phi. Here, e to the power i phi comes from Euler’s formula, which says e to the i phi equals cosine phi plus i times sine phi. Multiplying r by those components gives us back x y.\n\nWhen we analyze sinusoidal signals, like in AC circuits, we often know the frequency in advance. In that case, the important quantities are the magnitude r, which tells us the signal’s strength, and the phase angle phi, which tells us where the waveform starts in time.\nInstead of writing out the full exponential, we can use the simpler phasor notation: r angle phi. For example, if we know an AC current has a magnitude of 5 amperes and a phase angle of 30 degrees, we can write it as “5 at angle 30 degrees.”\n\nThis phasor approach is a very convenient way to describe sinusoidal signals, and as we’ll see, it makes circuit analysis much simpler.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

You can think of multiplying by i as rotating a vector by 90 degrees in the complex plane. For example, if we start with the unit vector at 1 on the real axis and multiply by i, it rotates to point straight up along the imaginary axis.\n\nIf we multiply by i again — another 90-degree rotation — we end up at negative 1 on the real axis. In other words, i times i equals –1. That’s the origin of the idea that i is the square root of negative one.\n\nMore generally, multiplying by e to the i theta rotates a vector by an angle theta, while multiplying by a real number r simply scales its length. This gives a very natural, visual way to think about complex multiplication — scaling changes the magnitude, and the exponential term changes the direction.\n\nAddition is also straightforward: if you have two complex numbers, u and v, you add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. Graphically, that’s just adding two vectors tip-to-tail to get u plus v.\nWith these rules for addition and multiplication, we have a complete algebraic system for complex numbers.

But for a capacitor, we normally describe the relationship in terms of a derivative or an integral — for example, i equals C times dv over dt.\n\nHowever, when we work in the phasor domain, something elegant happens. The derivative operation in the time domain becomes a simple multiplication by j omega in the frequency domain. This means that, for sinusoidal signals, the voltage–current relationship for a capacitor can look just like Ohm’s Law — except that instead of a real resistance, we have a complex quantity called impedance.\nHere’s the key point: in any linear circuit made up of resistors, capacitors, and inductors, if we drive it with a pure sinusoidal signal, the output will also be a sinusoid at the exact same frequency. The amplitude may change, and the waveform may shift in phase, but the frequency remains unchanged.\n\nFor example, suppose the voltage across a capacitor is A cosine omega t. Differentiating this to find the current shifts the waveform by 90 degrees and multiplies its amplitude by C omega. In phasor notation, this phase shift is written as “at an angle of + 90 degrees.”\nFinally, in the phasor domain, the capacitor’s impedance is 1 over j omega C.

That phase shift means the voltage leads the current by 90 degrees in an inductor — the exact opposite of a capacitor, where the current leads the voltage by 90 degrees.\n\nIn the phasor domain, this relationship is written simply as V equals j omega L times I. Here, j omega L plays the same role for an inductor that resistance R plays for a resistor — it’s the impedance. The only difference is that it’s a complex quantity, reflecting the phase relationship between voltage and current.\n\nSo once again, phasor notation allows us to generalize Ohm’s Law to all three basic components — resistor, capacitor, and inductor — using the single idea of impedance.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

This is a common way to pass a signal from one stage of a system to the next.\n\nA real-world example might be a sensor connected to a measurement device. The human body, for instance, has its own electrical impedance. If we were measuring a cardiac signal, we could model the body’s impedance as R 1. The second resistor, R 2, could represent the input impedance of our measuring instrument.\n\nFrom an engineering perspective, we usually have three goals when designing such a circuit:\nLarge input resistance — We want R1 to be large so that most of the input voltage appears across it, ensuring we capture as much of the signal as possible.\nSmall output resistance — We want R2 to be small so the next stage in the circuit can take the signal without losing much voltage.\nHigh gain — If possible, we want to amplify the signal to make it easier to detect and process.\n\nThese goals can sometimes conflict — for example, making R 1 large helps with capturing the signal, but we also want R 2 small for driving the next stage. Circuit design is about balancing these trade-offs.\nIn the example at the bottom right, R S is our sensor, whose resistance changes slightly by a factor of x in response to something like temperature or pressure. R_L is the load resistor. If x equals zero, the sensor is at its nominal value. When x changes, even by a small amount, the output voltage V out changes.\n\nMathematically, V out equals V in multiplied by the ratio R 2 over R 1 plus R 2. This is just the voltage divider rule we’ve seen before. In practice, the change in x might be very small, so the change in V out is tiny — often just a few millivolts.

This is called the null mode — no signal at the output when the bridge is balanced.\n\nNow, if one of the resistors — typically R 3 — is actually a sensor whose resistance changes slightly, say from R knot to R knot times (1 plus x), the bridge becomes unbalanced. This small change in R 3 produces a nonzero V out, even though the original background voltage was canceled out.\n\nIn deflection mode, we can write V out as the supply voltage V c c multiplied by the difference between the left divider ratio and the right divider ratio. Because the bridge starts balanced, even a very small change in R 3 creates a measurable output.\nThe advantage is that we’ve removed the large constant voltage and isolated only the change we care about. This makes it possible to apply high gain to that small signal without saturating the system.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Their voltage–current relationship does not form a straight line.\nFor example, a diode only allows significant current to flow in one direction once the forward voltage reaches a certain threshold — about 0.7 volts for silicon and 0.3 volts for germanium. In reverse bias, very little current flows until breakdown occurs.\nTransistors, such as the NPN bipolar junction transistor shown here, can amplify signals. By carefully biasing the base–emitter junction, a small change in base current controls a much larger change in collector current. This allows weak input signals to be amplified into stronger output signals.\n\nWe also have digital logic gates — OR, AND, XOR, NOR, NAND, and NOT — which are the building blocks of digital electronics. They process binary signals, producing specific outputs based on logical rules. By combining these gates, we can create flip-flops and sequential circuits, which store and manipulate digital information.\n\nNonlinear components make it possible to build amplifiers, oscillators, logic circuits, and microprocessors.

A diode has a strong directional preference for current flow. In its forward direction, the current rises rapidly after a certain threshold voltage — about 0.7 volts for silicon. In the reverse direction, the current is extremely small until breakdown occurs. This is a clearly nonlinear voltage–current relationship.\n\nIf we combine two diodes in a specific configuration, we create a transistor. A transistor takes a small signal at its input and produces a much larger version of the same signal shape at its output — it acts as an amplifier. This ability to magnify weak signals makes the transistor an essential building block for electronics.\n\nMultiple transistors can be combined to perform logic operations. For example, an AND gate outputs a high voltage only if both inputs are high. An OR gate outputs a high voltage if either input is high. More complex gates, like NAND, NOR, and XOR, can be built from these basic ideas.\nBy connecting logic gates, we can create circuits that add, multiply, store data, and make decisions — the very basis of digital computers.\n\nThis is why in electronics we need to understand both linear and nonlinear systems.

The internal circuitry can look complicated, but for analysis, we can use a simple model:\nWe apply a small input voltage, V in, between the non-inverting and inverting inputs.

This means it can capture a signal from a source without significantly loading it. On the other hand, when we take the signal from the output port, the impedance is very low. This allows the signal to drive the next stage efficiently. In this way, the op amp satisfies the two opposing requirements we discussed earlier: high input impedance and low output impedance.\n\nThis principle applies to both DC and AC circuit analysis. Remember the voltage–current relationships for resistors, capacitors, and inductors. When you connect these components into a network, Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law and Kirchhoff’s Current Law give you enough equations to solve for all unknowns.\n\nThe beauty of phasor notation is that for AC steady-state circuits, you don’t need to solve differential equations. You simply work with algebraic equations, just as in DC analysis. This is why, in a sense, we can say “AC is DC in disguise” — at least for steady-state analysis.\nOf course, if you’re dealing with transients — for example, when a signal is suddenly applied — you would still need to solve the time-domain differential equations. But once the system reaches steady state, algebraic methods are enough.\n\nThese circuit concepts are applied in many areas — from sensing signals in medical imaging to filtering unwanted noise.

Over the past few centuries, humanity has gone through several major transformations. We began with the Industrial Revolution — when machines took over physical labor and reshaped manufacturing, transportation, and the way we lived. Then came the Information Revolution, where computers and the internet allowed us to store, process, and share knowledge at unprecedented speed.\n\nNow, with the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, we are entering what I like to call the Intelligence Revolution. This is not just about automating tasks — it’s about creating machines that can learn, adapt, and make decisions, performing tasks that were once thought to be exclusively human.\n\nThis shift will influence every aspect of life — from science and medicine to education, communication, and beyond. It’s a change as profound as the revolutions before it, but one that reaches directly into the realm of thought and reasoning.\n\nWhen we look at the history of science, we can see that it has evolved through distinct paradigms over time. Thousands of years ago, science was primarily empirical. People described natural phenomena based on what they could directly observe — carefully recording patterns in nature without necessarily understanding the underlying mechanisms.\n\nA few hundred years ago, the theoretical branch emerged. This was a major leap forward: scientists began building mathematical models and generalizations, allowing them not just to describe the world, but to predict and explain it.\nIn the past few decades, we’ve added a computational branch. With powerful computers, we can now simulate complex phenomena that are impossible to test directly, exploring theories in silico before ever stepping into a laboratory.\n\nAnd today, we have entered a new era — the era of data exploration, often called eScience. Here, we unify theory, experiment, and simulation, but our driving force is data itself. Instruments and sensors capture enormous amounts of information, which is then processed by software and stored in vast databases. From there, we can apply data analytics, statistics, and increasingly, machine learning to extract patterns, features, and relationships directly from the data.\n\nThis approach — using big data and AI to uncover new knowledge — is so different that some call it the “fourth paradigm” of science. It represents a shift in thinking: instead of starting with a theory, we can sometimes let the data speak for itself.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

This is essentially the neuron’s transmission cable, carrying electrical signals — known as action potentials — toward the axon terminals. Along the way, the signal may be sped up by segments of myelin sheath, which act as insulation.\n\nAt the axon terminals, the neuron communicates with its target cells — which could be other neurons, muscle fibers, or glands — across small gaps called synapses. Communication here happens chemically, through the release of neurotransmitters, or in some cases, electrically.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that neurons are not just passive wires.

They collect all incoming information, both excitatory and inhibitory.\nIf the combined strength of these signals is strong enough to cross a certain threshold, the neuron generates an electrical pulse called an action potential. This signal travels down the axon — the long fiber you see here — and moves toward the axon terminals.\n\nAt the axon terminals, the neuron communicates with the next cell, often through a synapse. There, chemical messengers or direct electrical connections pass the information forward, continuing the chain of processing in the nervous system.\nThis is the fundamental process behind everything from reflexes to complex thought — and it’s also the biological inspiration for how artificial neural networks process information in AI systems.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

It receives input through many branches, called dendrites. All of these signals are gathered in the main cell body, the soma. If the combined signal is strong enough, the neuron generates an electrical pulse that travels down the axon. Finally, it reaches the output interface — the synapse — where it passes the signal on to other neurons.\nBelow that is the mathematical model we use for an artificial neuron. Each input is represented as a variable, and not all inputs carry the same importance, so we assign a weight to each one. Larger weights mean that input has a bigger influence; smaller weights mean less influence.\n\nThe neuron first performs a linear operation — a weighted sum of all the inputs, which is essentially an inner product. But that’s not enough. Just like in biology, small random fluctuations — small “nudges” — are ignored. Only when the total input crosses a certain threshold does the neuron respond strongly. This is where the nonlinear transformation comes in, producing the actual output.\nSo, in short: first we sum the inputs in a weighted way, then we pass the result through a nonlinear function that decides whether to respond — and how strongly.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Each input has a weight, shown as w 1,w 2,w 3,…,w n​, which controls how important that input is.\n\nThe first thing we do is multiply each input by its weight. Then we sum them all together — this is an inner product operation. Often, we also add an extra term called a bias, b, which shifts the output. You can think of the bias as an offset — a way to control the baseline response of the neuron, even if all the inputs are zero.\n\nOnce we have this weighted sum, we pass it through a nonlinear function, which we usually call the activation function. Here it’s labeled \nsigma. This step is essential — without it, the perceptron would just be a simple linear device.\nThere are many choices for the activation function. A common one is the sigmoid, which produces an S-shaped curve. Another is the hyperbolic tangent, or tanh, which gives outputs between minus one and plus one. There are also piecewise-linear functions such as the ReLU — the rectified linear unit — where the output is zero for negative inputs and increases proportionally for positive inputs.\n\nSo in short: a perceptron takes weighted inputs, adds them up, applies a bias, and then uses a nonlinear transformation to produce its output.

Each neuron in a hidden layer takes the outputs from the previous layer, applies its weights, sums them up, passes the result through its activation function, and then sends the output to the next layer. These hidden layers are where the network learns increasingly complex patterns.\n\nFinally, at the far right, we have the output layer.

The goal is to make this error as small as possible.\nOne common approach is gradient descent. We start with an initial set of weights — often chosen randomly. Then, in each training step, we look at the slope of the error function with respect to each weight. This slope, or gradient, tells us which direction increases the error — so we move in the opposite direction, reducing the error.\n\nMathematically, the new weight vector equals the old weight vector, minus a small fraction of the gradient.

This opens the door to faster reconstructions, better image quality, and even reduced radiation dose in certain applications.\nIn short, deep learning isn’t just another tool in the box — it has the potential to transform the way we produce and interpret medical images.\n\nNow let’s look at one practical example — improving the signal-to-noise ratio in images.\nIn medical imaging, noise is inevitable. It can come from the physics of the scanner, from the patient’s movement, or from trying to keep the radiation dose low. Traditionally, we use filtering techniques to clean up an image, but these often blur fine details along with the noise.\n\nWith modern machine learning, we can do better. By training neural networks on large datasets — for example, the thousands of scans acquired every day in hospitals — the system can learn what a “clean” image should look like, without erasing important diagnostic details. Instead of throwing those routine scans away, we can use them to teach the network.\nAs a result, we can transform a noisy scan into one that is much clearer, improving both diagnostic confidence and patient safety.\nSo that’s the big picture — and we’ll wrap up here for today.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

The reason is simple: once you understand the basics of image quality assessment, you can apply these ideas to almost any imaging modality.\nNo matter whether we’re talking about X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, or optical imaging, the general principles remain the same. Concepts such as resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and artifacts are universal. They may appear in different forms, but the underlying logic applies everywhere.\n\nThe good news is that this chapter is relatively easy reading compared to some of the heavier mathematical topics we’ve already tackled. The ideas are straightforward. If you follow carefully and think through the examples, you’ll see how each concept connects to real images.\n\nFor today’s lecture, I will guide you mainly through three key aspects of image quality assessment. We’ll start with general mathematical measures, then move to system-specific characteristics, and finally consider task-specific and human-observer models. This will give you a well-rounded view of what it means to evaluate image quality in practice.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

We’ll approach image quality assessment from three perspectives: general measures, system-specific measures, and task-specific measures.\n\nFirst, we’ll talk about general measures. Imagine you have an image and you also know the ground truth — the ideal image you want to reconstruct. The goal is to measure how close your reconstructed image is to the ground truth. The simplest way is to calculate the difference between the two. In mathematics, we often describe this using the idea of a distance in a vector space. The most familiar example is the Euclidean distance, which leads directly to the mean squared error, or MSE.\n\nThere are other distances too. One example I’ll briefly mention is the Kullback–Leibler divergence, or KL distance. This is a bit trickier, so I won’t test you on it, but it’s good to be aware of. And then there is a very practical and powerful concept called structural similarity, or SSIM. This has become extremely influential — the original paper has been cited tens of thousands of times — because it captures how humans actually perceive similarity between images. We’ll look at why this idea is so effective.\n\nNext, we move to system-specific measures. Think of the imaging system as a kind of camera — it could be an X-ray detector, an ultrasound probe, or an MRI scanner. Every camera has its own specifications. Here we’ll talk about how noisy the images are, how well the system can distinguish a signal from background noise, and what kind of resolution it provides. Resolution itself has several dimensions: spatial resolution, contrast resolution, temporal resolution, and spectral resolution. We’ll also talk about artifacts — those misleading structures that appear in images even though they don’t exist in reality. Understanding noise, resolution, and artifacts is key to judging the performance of any imaging system.\n\nFinally, we’ll cover task-specific measures. This perspective is slightly different. Instead of asking “How good is my camera?”, we ask “How well does this imaging system perform a specific clinical task?” For example, can it reliably detect whether a bone is fractured? Can it identify a tumor in the lung? The most important thing in medicine is whether the imaging system helps doctors and patients make correct decisions. Even if a system isn’t perfect in a technical sense, if it consistently allows us to succeed in the clinical task, then it’s doing its job.\n\nSo these three aspects — general, system-specific, and task-specific — are connected, but they are not identical. Together they give us a complete picture of how to assess image quality. We’ll begin with the first: general measures.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

Each image is made up of many pixels, indexed by i. If the image is 512 by 512, then the total number of pixels, n, is over 260,000.\n\nThe formula for MSE is simple:\u000bMSE equals one over n, times the sum from i equals one to n, of the difference between y-sub-i and y-hat-sub-i, squared.\nIn words, this means we compare the two images pixel by pixel. At each pixel, we take the difference, square it so that positive and negative errors don’t cancel out, and then average over all pixels. That gives us the mean squared error.\nNow, let’s go a bit deeper. When we estimate a parameter — say theta — we often write the estimate as theta-hat. The error between theta-hat and the true value theta can be analyzed in expectation, meaning averaged over many trials. When you expand the algebra, you find that the mean squared error naturally splits into two parts.\n\nThe first part is the variance. This tells us how much our estimates fluctuate around their average value. You can think of variance as a measure of random scatter.\n\nThe second part is the bias squared. This measures the difference between the average of our estimates and the true value. If our method consistently overshoots or undershoots, that’s bias.\n\nSo, in summary: MSE equals variance plus bias squared. Variance captures random error, bias captures systematic error, and together they define the total error.\n\nThis decomposition is very useful. It reminds us that an algorithm might have low variance but high bias, or vice versa. Understanding both helps us judge the quality of an estimator or an image reconstruction method.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

There are several variants, each with slightly different properties.\n\nThe first, which we’ve already discussed, is the Mean Squared Error, or MSE. This is the average of the squared differences between prediction and truth.\nA closely related measure is the Root Mean Squared Error, or RMSE. Here we simply take the square root of the mean squared error. Why? Because this brings the units back to the same scale as the original measurement. For example, if we are measuring pixel intensities, RMSE will be expressed in the same units as those intensities, which makes it easier to interpret.\n\nOne important property of squaring is that it emphasizes larger errors much more strongly. If a difference is 100, squaring turns it into 10,000. That means MSE and RMSE heavily penalize large deviations.\nSometimes we want a measure that treats all errors more equally. That’s where the Mean Absolute Error, or MAE, comes in. Instead of squaring, we take the absolute value of the difference at each pixel, then average. This is also called the L1 norm, while MSE is associated with the L2 norm. The L1 norm is less sensitive to outliers compared to the L2 norm.\n\nFinally, we have the Mean Absolute Percentage Error, or MAPE. This is the mean absolute error expressed as a percentage of the true value. In other words, it’s MAE divided by the ground truth at each point, multiplied by 100 percent. This can be useful when we want to understand an error in relative terms — for example, saying “the error is 5 percent” rather than giving a raw number.\n\nSo, these different distance measures — MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE — give us different perspectives on error. The choice depends on the problem: do we want to penalize large errors more, or do we care more about relative error percentages?", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

Think about it this way: you have one signal or one image, and you also have a standard — the ground truth. \n\nBy comparing them pixel by pixel, we’re essentially measuring the difference between two curves, or between two surfaces, or even between two volumes in three dimensions.\nThe formula reduces to something very intuitive: it’s about the area between the two curves. The yellow region you see here represents those differences. The larger the area, the greater the error.\n\nThis is why MSE and related measures are so widely used — they give us a direct and interpretable way to say how close or how far two images are. It’s simple, mathematically neat, and visually intuitive.\n\nBut here’s an important point: while this is a good first step, it is not the whole story. Measuring differences point by point tells us something, but not everything. In medical imaging, we also care about structural similarity, system behavior, and clinical tasks.

This is where probability theory comes in.\n\nSuppose you don’t just have two images, but instead you have two probability distributions — for example, two different histograms of pixel values. The question becomes: how do we measure the difference between these two distributions?\nOne option is to use Euclidean distance, just as before. But there is a more meaningful way in the context of information theory. This is called the Kullback–Leibler divergence, or KL distance for short.\n\nThe formula looks a bit unusual:\u000bKL divergence equals the sum over x of p of x, multiplied by the logarithm of p of x divided by q of x.\nYou don’t need to worry too much about the details — this is beyond the scope of our lecture — but the idea is important. The KL divergence is always greater than or equal to zero, and it becomes exactly zero if and only if the two distributions are identical.\n\nOne interesting property is that the KL divergence is not symmetric. In other words, the distance from P to Q is not the same as the distance from Q to P. That may sound strange, but it has a good analogy. Think of climbing a mountain: going uphill is much harder than going back downhill, even though it’s the same physical path. In the same way, KL divergence measures directionality in information.\n\nSo, while we won’t use this directly in our course, it’s good to be aware that such information-based distances exist. They play a big role in areas like machine learning and statistical signal processing.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

For example, suppose we have two variables, X and Y. If they are completely independent, then measuring X tells us nothing about Y. In that case, their mutual information is zero. On the other hand, if X and Y are perfectly dependent — meaning that once you know X, you completely know Y — then their mutual information is very high. Most real-world situations fall somewhere in between.\n\nMathematically, mutual information can actually be expressed in terms of the KL divergence. Specifically, it’s the KL divergence between the joint distribution of X and Y, and the product of their marginal distributions. Don’t worry about the details of the formula — the key idea is that it quantifies how much information one variable provides about the other.\nYou can also think of it this way: when you measure one variable, how much does your uncertainty about the other variable decrease? That decrease in uncertainty is exactly what mutual information captures.\n\nIn practice, this idea is very useful in areas like image registration, where we align two images. Instead of just matching pixel intensities, we can maximize the mutual information between the two images. That way, even if the images look very different in terms of brightness or contrast, we can still measure how well they correspond.\n\nSo, mutual information is essentially a generalization of correlation, but in the language of information theory. It goes beyond simple linear relationships and captures any kind of statistical dependence.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

Think of it as a measure of uncertainty. If you have a probability distribution that is very spread out and uniform, then you have a lot of uncertainty — you don’t really know what the outcome will be. That means the entropy is high.\nOn the other hand, if the distribution is sharply peaked — like a delta function, where one outcome is guaranteed — then there is no uncertainty. In that case, the entropy is very low, even zero.\n\nSo entropy tells us how much information, or how much unpredictability, is contained in a random variable. In information theory, this is a central concept because information itself is really about reducing uncertainty.\nNow, mutual information can be written as the difference between two entropies: the entropy of Y by itself, minus the entropy of Y given X. In other words, it measures how much uncertainty about Y is reduced when you know X. That’s exactly what we mean by “how much does X tell us about Y.”\nAgain, you don’t need to get bogged down in the formulas here. The key point is: entropy captures uncertainty, and mutual information measures how two variables share or reduce that uncertainty.\n\nFor our purposes, I just want you to know that these information-theoretic measures — KL divergence, mutual information, and entropy — are very powerful, but they are more advanced than what we need right now. Think of them as tools in the background, which complement the simpler measures like mean squared error.\n\nAnd with that, we will soon return to the more practical measures that are directly used in image quality assessment.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

Below it, you see five different degraded versions of the same image. Some look noisy, some are blurry, and some have other distortions. Clearly, to the human eye, these images do not look equally good.\n\nBut here’s the problem: when we compute the mean squared error between the original image and each of these five degraded ones, the result is the same — two hundred and twenty-five. Mathematically, MSE tells us they are equally different from the original.\nVisually, though, that’s obviously not true. Some versions look much closer to the original, while others look far worse. Our eyes immediately pick up those differences, but MSE cannot.\n\nAnd this is the key point: MSE does not reflect human perception very well. It measures pixel-wise differences, but it cannot capture whether the overall structure of the image is preserved.\n\nThis leads us to the next important idea — we need a measure that better matches what humans actually see. That’s where structural similarity, or SSIM, comes in.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

MSE simply compares each pixel individually, treats every error the same, and then adds them up. That’s a bottom-up approach — starting from the smallest units and working upward.\nBut our visual system works very differently. We are much more sensitive to structural information — the patterns, edges, and relationships that give an image its overall form. For example, even a small change in the background, or a shift in texture, is something we can notice right away. Our brains are highly adapted to detect these kinds of contextual changes.\n\nIn the classical view, the focus was on error visibility: if you see a discrepancy, count it as an error. In the newer view, the focus shifts to structural distortion: what matters is whether the structure of the image has been preserved.\nThis also connects to the way our vision system interprets images. Rather than starting with tiny details, many researchers argue that we first process the global structure — sometimes described in terms of topological features. These are high-level properties, such as whether objects are connected, how many distinct regions there are, or whether certain shapes remain intact. Importantly, these properties don’t change if the image is stretched, rotated, or rescaled.\n\nSo here’s the philosophical shift: instead of measuring differences pixel by pixel, we want to measure how much of the structural information has been preserved. That is what structural similarity is all about, and it’s why it is far more aligned with how humans actually see images.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

What this paper introduced was a completely different perspective: instead of measuring errors, we should measure structural similarity.\nThe idea is built on the assumption that the human visual system is highly tuned to extract structural information from images. So rather than asking, “How many errors can we see?”, the SSIM framework asks, “How well is the structure of the image preserved?”\n\nThis shift in thinking turned out to be incredibly powerful. The paper has been cited tens of thousands of times, and SSIM quickly became a standard tool not only in image processing research but also in practical applications like video compression, image restoration, and medical imaging.\nSo, from this point forward, when we talk about perceptual image quality, we are really building on the foundation laid by this work.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

On the top row, both look quite similar to the original. One produces an SSIM value of 0.949, the other 0.989. These numbers are very close to one, reflecting the fact that the images are almost identical to our eyes.\nOn the bottom row, however, we see very different results. One image has been heavily pixelated, another blurred, and another corrupted with noise. When compared to the original, their SSIM values drop significantly — around 0.67, 0.69, and about 0.72. That means they retain only about two-thirds of the structural similarity.\n\nThe important thing here is that SSIM values line up with what we visually perceive.

The first step is to look at their luminance, which simply means the average brightness level. We measure the mean intensity of each image and make sure we are comparing them on the same scale.\n\nNext, we look at the contrast. This is captured by the standard deviation — how much the pixel values vary around the mean. A high standard deviation means strong contrast, while a low standard deviation means the image looks flat or washed out. So we compute the standard deviation for each image to quantify its contrast.\n\nAfter normalizing for luminance and contrast, we focus on the most important part: the structure. This step captures how patterns of pixels in one image relate to patterns in the other — whether the edges, textures, and fine details line up.\n\nFinally, SSIM combines all three comparisons — luminance, contrast, and structure — into a single value between zero and one. A score of one means the images are structurally identical. A lower score means important structural information has been lost.\n\nSo, in summary: SSIM works by checking three things — do the images have the same brightness, the same contrast, and the same structural patterns? When all three align, we say the images are very similar.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

Suppose we have an image X with N pixels. To find its average brightness, or mean, we simply add up all the pixel values and divide by N. This gives us the mean value, which we call mu of X.\nNext, we remove the mean by subtracting the mean of X from every pixel. This is the first step of normalization — it centers the image so that the average brightness is zero.\n\nOnce we have the mean, we can also compute the standard deviation. This measures how much the pixel values vary around the mean. Notice that the formula here uses 1 divided by N minus 1, not just N. That detail comes from statistics — it gives us an unbiased estimate of the standard deviation.\nFinally, we can normalize the image even further by dividing each pixel by the standard deviation. After this second step of normalization, the transformed image will have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. In other words, it has been rescaled so that brightness and contrast are standardized.\nWe repeat this process for both images, X and Y. Only then do we compare them — first in terms of luminance, then contrast, and finally their structural relationship.\n\nSo, these are the basic operations behind SSIM. They are simple statistical tools, but together they allow us to capture how similar two images are in terms of brightness, contrast, and structure.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

In other words, order doesn’t matter. If you compare image A with image B, you should get the same result as comparing image B with image A.\nSecond, boundedness. The similarity value should always be between zero and one. A score of one means the images are perfectly identical. A score closer to zero means they are very different.\nThird, a unique maximum. The similarity should only reach the maximum value of one if the two images are exactly the same, pixel for pixel.

The constant C1 is added to make the formula stable — otherwise, if both means are very close to zero, the denominator becomes tiny and the ratio unstable.\nTo choose C1, we take the square of K1 times L, where L is the dynamic range of pixel values. For an 8-bit grayscale image, L is 255. K1 is just a very small number, much less than one.\n\nNow, notice a few important properties:\nIf the two means are equal, then the numerator and denominator are the same, so the luminance comparison equals 1, meaning perfect similarity.\nIf the two means are very different, the numerator becomes small relative to the denominator, so the luminance comparison approaches 0, meaning poor similarity.\n\nThis simple formula ensures that luminance similarity satisfies the three postulates we discussed earlier: it is symmetric, bounded between 0 and 1, and it reaches the maximum value of 1 only when the two images have identical mean brightness.\nSo luminance is the first step in measuring structural similarity. Next, we’ll look at contrast comparison.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

And we let mu-Y, the mean of image Y, be represented by the variable X. Now, the question is: as X changes, what value of X will maximize the luminance comparison?\nTo answer this, we take the formula for the luminance term and compute its first derivative with respect to X. By setting that derivative equal to zero, we can find the point where the function reaches its maximum.\n\nWhen we go through the algebra, the conclusion is very clear: the maximum occurs when X equals A, in other words, when the mean brightness of image Y is equal to the mean brightness of image X. At that point, the luminance comparison reaches its maximum possible value, which is one.\nThis confirms the intuition: two images will only be perfectly similar in luminance if their average brightness levels are the same. If one image is brighter or darker than the other, the luminance comparison will drop accordingly.\n\nSo this mathematical exercise is really just a proof of what we already expect: the luminance term is maximized when the two images have the same mean brightness.\nThat’s the first aspect of structural similarity.

One might look sharp and vivid, while the other looks flat or washed out. To capture this, we use the standard deviation of pixel values — sigma-X for image X and sigma-Y for image Y.\n\nThe formula for contrast comparison looks very similar to the one we used for luminance. It is written as:\nC of X and Y equals two times sigma-X times sigma-Y, plus a constant C2, divided by sigma-X squared plus sigma-Y squared, plus that same constant C2.\n\nHere again, the constant is added to prevent instability when values are close to zero. C2 is defined as K2 times L squared, where L is the dynamic range of the image.\nNow, notice how this works:\nIf the two images have the same standard deviation, meaning their contrasts are the same, then the numerator and denominator match, and the contrast comparison equals 1.\nIf one image has much higher or lower contrast than the other, then the ratio becomes smaller, and the similarity drops.\nThis design is also consistent with how the human visual system works. For example, in a very dark room, small changes in brightness can be quite noticeable. But in a very bright, high-contrast scene, the same small changes are much harder to see. The formula reflects this effect, sometimes called contrast masking.\n\nSo contrast is the second pillar of structural similarity — it ensures that two images not only have the same average brightness but also the same level of variation around that average.\nNext, we’ll look at the third pillar: the structural comparison.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

This is exactly what Weber’s law describes. It states that the smallest noticeable change in a stimulus is proportional to the background level of that stimulus.\n\nFor example, if you are in a very dark room, even a tiny spot of light is noticeable right away. But if you are in a brightly lit room, the very same tiny light would be invisible. The background intensity is so high that the small change is masked.\nYou’ve probably experienced this outdoors: at night, under a dark sky, you can see countless stars. But during the day, those same stars are still there — yet you can’t see them, because the bright background light overwhelms them.\nThe same principle applies to hearing. In a quiet room, even a whisper can be heard. But in a noisy party, you need to shout for anyone to notice.\n\nMathematically, this means that the sensitivity of the contrast measure depends on the ratio of the change, delta-X, to the baseline, X. If X is small, even a small delta makes a big difference. If X is large, the same delta hardly matters.\nSo the contrast term in SSIM naturally captures this idea — it reflects the fact that our visual system is tuned to relative, not absolute, differences. This is why the measure agrees so well with human perception.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

Again, the difference is 10. But this time, it’s much harder to notice the difference.\n\nWhy? Because the background level — the total number of dots — is so much higher. A change of 10 is a large fraction when the background is only 10, but it’s a tiny fraction when the background is already 110.\nThis illustrates the principle we just discussed: what our visual system detects is not the absolute change, but the relative change — delta divided by the background.\n\nSo, when we design a similarity measure, we want it to reflect this property of human vision. And that’s exactly what the contrast comparison in SSIM does. It behaves in a way that is consistent with how we see.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

Once we normalize each image — removing its mean brightness and adjusting its contrast — what’s left is essentially its structure. This is where we ask: do the patterns, textures, and shapes in the two images align?\nMathematically, this is captured using the cross-correlation between the two images. We call it sigma-X-Y, which measures how the variations in image X line up with the variations in image Y. To make the measure stable, we again introduce a constant, just like we did with luminance and contrast.\n\nAnother way to think about this is in terms of vectors in high-dimensional space. Imagine each image as a vector, with each pixel value being one coordinate. The structural similarity is then like taking the inner product of these two vectors, normalized by their lengths. Geometrically, this is just the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.\n\nIf the two vectors point in exactly the same direction — meaning the images are identical up to scaling — the angle is zero, and the similarity is maximized.\nIf they are completely uncorrelated, the inner product is small, and the similarity is low.\nThis is the same intuition we used when studying Fourier analysis: a Fourier coefficient is computed by projecting a signal onto a basis function. Here, we are projecting one image onto another and measuring how well they align.\n\nSo, structural comparison boils down to asking: once brightness and contrast are accounted for, do the fine details and patterns of the two images still match?\nThat completes the three pillars of SSIM: luminance, contrast, and structure.

It tells us that the inner product of two vectors is always less than or equal to the product of their lengths. Equality holds only when the two vectors are linearly related — in other words, when one is just a scaled version of the other.\n\nWhy is this important here? Well, recall that in structural comparison, we represent each image as a vector in a high-dimensional space. The structural similarity is essentially the normalized inner product between those two vectors.\nThe Cauchy–Schwarz inequality guarantees that this similarity value will always lie between zero and one, and it will reach one only when the two images are structurally identical, differing at most by a scaling factor.\n\nSo, this inequality is the mathematical reason why the structural comparison term works. It’s not just a rule chosen arbitrarily — it’s grounded in solid geometry.\nAnd as engineers and scientists, it’s always valuable to know not just how something works, but why. Understanding the principle behind the rule allows you to be creative and adapt these ideas in new situations.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

Each one captures a different aspect of how two images may look alike or differ. The Structural Similarity Index, or SSIM, is built by combining all three.\nMathematically, the SSIM of X and Y is written as:\nluminance term raised to the power alpha, multiplied by the contrast term raised to the power beta, multiplied by the structure term raised to the power gamma.\n\nThe parameters alpha, beta, and gamma simply allow us to adjust the relative importance of the three components. In practice, we usually set all three equal to one, giving equal weight to luminance, contrast, and structure.\nTo keep the formula stable, we also include constants — C1, C2, and C3. These prevent divisions by very small numbers, which could make the result unstable. For convenience, researchers often set C3 equal to half of C2. These are empirical design choices, not strict theory, but they work well in practice.\nWith these simplifications, we arrive at the familiar form of SSIM that is widely used today. This measure is often referred to as the Universal Quality Index with stabilizing constants added.\n\nThe remarkable thing is how well SSIM works. Despite its simplicity, it has become one of the most widely used metrics for image quality, both in research and in industry. Even today, when we use deep learning and advanced algorithms for image processing, SSIM and mean squared error remain the standard reference metrics.\n\nSo, this is the moment where SSIM is born — a simple but powerful measure that aligns closely with human perception and has stood the test of time.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

The other five images are distorted versions, each with a different type of degradation: contrast stretching, mean shift, JPEG compression, blurring, and salt-and-pepper noise.\nIf we were to use mean squared error, all of these distorted images would end up with roughly the same error value. But visually, they do not look equally bad. Some are close to the original, while others are clearly worse.\n\nNow look at the SSIM scores shown here. The contrast-stretched image has an SSIM close to 0.92, which makes sense because it looks fairly good. The mean-shifted version scores about 0.90, also quite close. But the JPEG-compressed version drops down to around 0.69, and the blurred version to 0.70. The salt-and-pepper noisy image scores about 0.77.\nIf you compare these numbers with what your eyes tell you, the agreement is clear. Images that look closer to the original score higher; images that look worse score lower.\n\nThis is why SSIM is so widely used. It captures the essential aspects of the human visual system — brightness, contrast, and structure — in a single number. And in practice, this means we can use SSIM to guide optimization. For example, when designing a communication channel or an imaging system, we can adjust the system parameters to maximize SSIM, ensuring that the images produced look good to the human eye.\n\nSo, SSIM is not just a theoretical measure — it is a practical tool that connects mathematics directly to human perception.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

But in reality, most images are in color. So naturally, the first extension was to adapt SSIM for color image quality assessment. This involves measuring similarity not only in brightness and contrast, but also in the relationships between color channels.\n\nAnother extension is to video quality assessment. Here, SSIM is applied not just frame by frame, but also across time, because our eyes are sensitive to temporal consistency. This has become very important in areas like video compression and streaming.\nThere is also multi-scale SSIM, which evaluates images at different levels of resolution. This is especially useful because human vision itself operates on a multi-scale level — we notice both fine details and large structures, depending on how we view an image.\nAnd finally, there is complex wavelet SSIM, which can handle images that have complex values, such as those produced in MRI. This is a powerful extension that broadens SSIM to applications in medical imaging and beyond.\n\nThe core idea of SSIM — comparing luminance, contrast, and structure — has proven to be so flexible that it has been adapted to various domains.\n\nNow, let me pause here and use an analogy that connects to your own experience. When we design an exam, we want the scores to spread out enough to show meaningful differences among students. If everyone scores 90 or higher, we can’t distinguish performance very well. Ideally, the mean should be somewhere in the middle, say around 50, with variation above and below. That way, the test reveals the true distribution of understanding.\nIt’s the same idea with SSIM: we normalize by the mean and by the variation, so we can focus on the meaningful structural differences between signals.\n\nSo, whether we’re evaluating images or student performance, the principle is the same: measure differences relative to expectations and variability, not in absolute terms.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

To assess the quality of images produced by a system, we need to look at metrics that reflect the system’s performance.\n\nThis includes measures such as:\nNoise, and the related quantities signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR).\nResolution, which can be spatial, contrast, temporal, or spectral, depending on what aspect of the system we are evaluating.\nAnd finally, artifacts, which are false or misleading structures that appear in the image because of imperfections in the imaging process.\nTogether, these system-specific measures tell us how good a given imaging device is at capturing and representing reality.\n\nSo let’s begin this section with one of the most important system-specific measures: the signal-to-noise ratio, or SNR.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

Noise is unavoidable. It arises from the fundamental randomness of physical processes, and ultimately from quantum mechanics itself. Nothing is ever perfectly certain.\n\nOn top of this background noise, we have the signal — the part of the measurement that actually carries meaningful information.\nSNR is a simple but powerful way of expressing how strong the signal is relative to the noise. Mathematically, it is defined as the ratio of signal power to noise power. Since power is proportional to the square of amplitude, you can also write SNR as the square of the signal amplitude divided by the noise amplitude.\n\nHere’s the intuition:\nIf the SNR is around 1, the signal varies in the same range as the noise. That means the signal is barely visible.\nIf the SNR is 5 or 10 or higher, the signal stands out clearly above the noise, and it can be easily detected.\n\nA related measure is the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio, or CNR. Instead of comparing one signal to background noise, we compare the difference between two signals — for example, a feature versus its background — divided by the noise level. This measure is very common in medical imaging because it directly reflects how well we can distinguish one structure from another.\n\nSo, SNR tells us whether a signal can rise above the noise at all, while CNR tells us whether two signals can be distinguished against that noisy background.\nAnd next, we’ll move on to another fundamental aspect of image quality: resolution.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

For example, imagine two very small, bright points — like two tiny tumors. Mathematically, we describe each of those points as a delta function, which represents a perfect single dot.\n\nBut in reality, no imaging system can reproduce a perfect dot. Instead, each point becomes blurred into a small disk, usually shaped like a Gaussian curve. This blur is called the point spread function, or PSF. It tells us how the system responds to a single point source.\nNow, suppose we have two points. If they are far apart, even though each one is blurry, you can still clearly see two separate spots. But as they move closer together, the two blurred shapes begin to overlap. Eventually, when the separation between them is too small, the two spots merge and appear as one.\n\nThe critical threshold is defined by the full width at half maximum, or FWHM, of the point spread function. In other words, when the distance between the two points is equal to the width of the blur at half its height, that’s about the limit of what the imaging system can resolve. Any closer, and the system can no longer distinguish the two points.\n\nThis is why we say spatial resolution is the minimum separation at which two objects can still be seen as distinct. Often, when people talk about “resolution” in imaging, this is what they mean: the ability to resolve fine detail.\nAnother way to analyze resolution — which we’ll get to shortly — is through the modulation transfer function, or MTF, which uses Fourier analysis to quantify how well different spatial frequencies are preserved in the image.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

These components can be low frequency — representing smooth, gradual changes — or high frequency — representing fine details like sharp edges or thin lines.\nIf we feed a sinusoidal pattern into an imaging system, the system does not pass all frequencies equally well. Low-frequency components pass through almost perfectly. But as the frequency increases, the system begins to attenuate, or weaken, those components. At very high frequencies, the system may blur them so much that they become invisible.\n\nThe MTF curve shows this behavior. On the left side, at low frequencies, the modulation is close to 100 percent. As frequency increases, the response gradually drops. Eventually, at very high frequencies, the response falls to zero — meaning the system can no longer reproduce those details.\nA practical way to think about this is with a line-pair phantom, where black and white bars alternate like a test pattern. At low frequencies, the bars are wide, and the system can reproduce them clearly. At high frequencies, the bars get narrower and closer together. At some point, the system can no longer distinguish the bars — they blur into a uniform gray. That point defines the system’s resolution limit.\n\nSo MTF gives us a frequency-domain way of measuring resolution. It tells us not just whether two points can be separated, but how well the system preserves detail across different scales.\nThis measure is widely used in both medical imaging and general optics. It provides a more complete picture of resolution compared to the single-number definition from the point spread function.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

High-contrast resolution deals with distinguishing small, bright details — for example, two tiny dots very close together.\n\nContrast resolution, on the other hand, is about the ability of an imaging system to detect subtle differences in intensity. The structures may not be small — they may even be large — but if their contrast relative to the background is very low, they may be difficult to see.\nIn the example shown here, notice how in one image the faint circular structures stand out more clearly, while in the other they are barely visible against the noisy background. This difference reflects the system’s contrast resolution.\nClinically, this is very important. For example, in CT imaging, a tumor may look very similar in intensity to surrounding soft tissue, because both are made of similar biological material. A system with good contrast resolution allows the tumor to be detected clearly, while a noisy or lower-quality system might completely obscure it.\n\nBeyond contrast resolution, there are two more types of resolution we should briefly mention.\nTemporal resolution refers to how quickly an imaging system can capture a snapshot. A high-speed system can freeze motion — like capturing a sharp image of a beating heart. But if the acquisition is too slow, moving objects blur together. This is why, when you take a photo of a moving car with your phone, you sometimes see motion blur. In medical imaging, temporal resolution is critical for dynamic studies, such as cardiac CT or MRI.\nSpectral resolution refers to the ability of a system to distinguish between different frequencies or energies. In vision, this corresponds to color perception — someone with color blindness has poor spectral resolution. In imaging systems, spectral resolution allows us to distinguish X-rays of different energies or ultrasound waves of different frequencies. Better spectral resolution means finer discrimination of subtle differences in material properties.\n\nFinally, let’s talk about artifacts. Artifacts are false structures that appear in images but are not really there. They are “ghosts” created by limitations or mismatches in the imaging process. For example, in CT, the motion of the heart can create blurry or duplicated structures. In ultrasound, echoes may bounce back and forth and appear as multiple spots even though only one structure exists. Recognizing and understanding artifacts is critical, because they can mislead interpretation.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

When we take X-rays or CT scans, the metal is so dense that it blocks or severely distorts the X-ray beams. The reconstruction algorithm, however, assumes it has complete and accurate data along every path. It doesn’t “know” that some of the information is missing or corrupted.\n\nAs a result, the system produces streaks and bands radiating from the metal. These bright and dark lines are not real anatomical structures — they are purely computational artifacts caused by missing or distorted data.\nIn the figure here, the first column shows uncorrected CT images with severe streak artifacts. The last column shows the ground truth, what the anatomy should look like.\n\nResearchers have developed various ways to reduce these artifacts. One common method is NMAR, or normalized metal artifact reduction, which improves the image somewhat. More recently, deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks, have been applied to further clean up the image and recover structures hidden by artifacts.\nYou can see that the CNN results are closer to the ground truth, with clearer anatomy and fewer streaks.\n\nThe key point here is that artifacts are not real structures, but they can easily confuse interpretation. They depend on the imaging modality, the reconstruction algorithm, and the clinical situation.

These system specs are useful, but in practice, they don’t directly answer the most important question: Can the system help us make the right clinical decision?\n\nThink about it. As patients or physicians, we don’t actually care whether an image has 0.5-millimeter resolution or 1-millimeter resolution, or whether the noise level is 2 percent or 5 percent. What we really care about is whether the image allows us to detect a tumor, diagnose a fracture, or rule out disease with confidence.\n\nThat’s why task-based assessment is so important. It focuses on the end goal: whether the imaging system can successfully support the clinical task.\n\nSo in this last part of the lecture, we’ll discuss task-specific measures such as sensitivity and specificity, ROC and AUC analysis, human and mathematical observers, and even modern approaches like neural networks and radiomics.\n\nThese measures shift our attention from the imaging device itself to the diagnostic performance of the entire workflow, which is ultimately what matters most in medical imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

Each pixel can belong to one of two classes: edge or non-edge. Similarly, in medical imaging, each case can be classified as disease present or disease absent.\n\nThis gives us four possible outcomes:\nTrue Positive: The patient has a tumor, and the system or doctor correctly identifies it.\nTrue Negative: The patient is healthy, and the report correctly says no tumor.\nFalse Positive: The patient is healthy, but the system says there is a tumor. This can cause unnecessary anxiety, follow-up scans, or even invasive procedures.\nFalse Negative: The patient does have a tumor, but the system or doctor misses it. This is often the most serious error, because it can delay diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIn clinical practice, both types of errors matter. False positives burden patients emotionally and financially, while false negatives can cost lives by missing opportunities for early treatment.\nThat’s why doctors and imaging researchers often talk about sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity reflects how good a system is at detecting true positives — catching disease when it is really there. Specificity reflects how good a system is at avoiding false alarms — correctly identifying when disease is not present.\n\nThese terms can be confusing at first, but they are central to evaluating diagnostic imaging systems. They shift the focus away from just image sharpness or resolution and toward what really matters: whether the imaging system can support accurate medical decisions.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

In formula form, it is:\nSensitivity equals TP over TP plus FN.\n\nIn other words, sensitivity answers the question: “If the patient really has the disease, how likely are we to detect it?”\nFor example, suppose 100 patients truly have lung cancer. If our system correctly detects 50 of them, but misses the other 50, then the sensitivity is 50%. Sensitivity is essentially a measure of how confident we are when we say “Yes, disease is present.”\nNow let’s move to specificity.\nSpecificity is the proportion of true negatives among all actual negative cases. The formula is:\nSpecificity equals TN over TN plus FP.\n\nThis answers the question: “If the patient really does not have the disease, how likely are we to correctly say no?”\nFor example, if 100 healthy people are scanned, and 95 are correctly reported as negative while 5 are mistakenly labeled as positive, the specificity is 95%. Specificity is essentially a measure of how confident we are when we say “No, there is no disease.”\n\nSo, in summary:\nSensitivity tells us how good we are at catching disease cases.\nSpecificity tells us how good we are at avoiding false alarms.\n\nBoth are critical in clinical imaging.

This shows the system rarely gave false alarms.\nPositive Predictive Value (PPV): 22 out of 73 reported positives were real TB cases → only 30%. This is much lower, meaning that when the system flagged a case as positive, it was wrong more often than it was right.\nNegative Predictive Value (NPV): 1,739 out of 1,747 reported negatives were truly healthy → nearly 99.5%.

That means I’ll catch nearly every true case, so sensitivity will be very high. But I’ll also generate many false alarms, so specificity will drop.\nOn the other hand, if I set the threshold very high, I’ll call almost everything normal. That means I’ll have very few false alarms — so specificity will be excellent. But I’ll also miss many real cases, so sensitivity will be low.\n\nThe ROC curve captures this trade-off. On the x-axis, we plot 1 – specificity, which is the false positive rate. On the y-axis, we plot sensitivity, the true positive rate. By sweeping through all possible thresholds, we trace out the curve.\nThe ROC curve shows the overall performance of the test across all possible decision boundaries. And importantly, the area under the ROC curve, or AUC, provides a single number to summarize diagnostic accuracy. An AUC of 1.0 means perfect classification. An AUC of 0.5 — a diagonal line — means the test is no better than random guessing.\n\nSo the ROC curve is widely used in medical imaging research, because it provides a clear, quantitative way to compare diagnostic systems and observer performance.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

Healthy patients tend to cluster around one range, while diseased patients cluster around another. But because of biological variation, measurement noise, and overlapping physiology, there is no perfect separation.\n\nSo when the two distributions overlap, a threshold placed in the middle will inevitably create two types of errors.

Their separation is weaker, the overlap is greater, and the ROC curve lies closer to the diagonal. In the extreme case, if you cannot tell disease from normal at all, your decision is no better than flipping a coin — that’s the chance line.\n\nSo diagnostic performance is shaped by two things: the reader’s skill and the technology’s power. Better imaging systems reduce overlap, but equally important is the ability of the radiologist to interpret the image correctly.\n\nThat’s why, in practice, the same scan might lead to different conclusions depending on who reads it.

A perfect test, one that never misses disease and never gives false alarms, would trace along the top and left borders, with an AUC equal to 1.

Human reader studies are expensive, time-consuming, and often inconsistent — one doctor may interpret an image differently than another. If we want to optimize imaging systems or evaluate new reconstruction methods, relying on large-scale human studies is not always feasible.\n\nSo instead, we can build a numerical observer that “looks” at the images and performs the task — whether that’s detecting a small tumor, classifying an abnormality, or distinguishing between signal and noise.\nIn this review paper by Xin He and Subok Park from the FDA, the authors summarize the foundations of model observers in medical imaging research.

You can think of it as a large matrix that tells us how each point in the object contributes to the measured image. For instance, in CT, H would represent all the X-ray projections and how they are combined.\nThen comes n, the noise. Every real imaging system is contaminated by noise — whether it’s photon noise, electronic noise, or other random fluctuations. That uncertainty is inherent to the physics of measurement.\n\nFinally, g is what we actually record — the image data. So what you see on the screen is not the object itself, but rather the result of the object being transformed by the system response and corrupted by noise.\nThis linear system model is the foundation for both image reconstruction and image analysis.

Depending on the situation, we might know exactly what that signal looks like, or only know its general statistical properties. For example, in phantom studies, we know exactly what pattern is inserted, but in real patients, tumors can vary in shape, size, and contrast.\nTo simplify the discussion, we often imagine a “clean” background image without noise, and a “clean” signal image without noise. The actual measurement we record is just those two components, combined with noise from the imaging process.\n\nSo in essence, the classification task is: given the measured image, do we believe it came from the background-only case, or from the background-plus-signal case?\nThis very simple framework — background versus background plus signal — forms the basis of many observer models in medical imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

For this image, there are two possible explanations:\nHypothesis zero says it comes from a normal case, with no abnormality.\nHypothesis one says it comes from an abnormal case, where a signal, such as a tumor, is present.\n\nThe ideal observer looks at both possibilities and asks: given the data I see, how likely is it that it came from the normal case, and how likely is it that it came from the abnormal case?\nThe decision is then based on whichever likelihood is greater. If the abnormal case is more likely, the observer calls it abnormal; if the normal case is more likely, the observer calls it normal.\n\nThis simple but powerful rule — often called the likelihood ratio test — provides an upper bound on performance. No other observer, whether it’s another model or even an expert human reader, can systematically do better.\nThat’s why the ideal observer always produces the highest possible ROC curve for the task.

In other words, we reduce the entire image into a single number — a test statistic. That number is then used to decide whether the case is more likely normal or abnormal.\n\nThe Hotelling Observer is designed to be the best possible linear observer. What does “best” mean here? It means the observer chooses its template in a way that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio — the separation between the diseased and non-diseased cases. The larger the separation, the easier the decision becomes.\nThis is why the Hotelling Observer is so widely studied. It strikes a balance: not as powerful as the ideal observer, but still mathematically optimal within the class of linear decision rules.\n\nAnd if we don’t even want to use all the image data, we can go a step further.

Each channel acts like a filter or a template that extracts a particular aspect of the image. Think of them as different ‘views’ or ‘features’ of the same data.\nWhen we apply these channels to the image, we get a series of scalar responses — simple numbers that summarize how the image looks under each channel. We then collect these responses into a much smaller vector, which is far easier to work with than the original full image data.\nThis is what’s known as a channelized observer.

Because instead of trying to analyze the entire frequency spectrum all at once, we divide it into pieces. Each channel captures information from one part of the spectrum. When we apply these filters to an image, we can see how strongly the image responds to each band of frequencies.\n\nThis is very powerful because medical images contain structures at many different scales — some large and smooth, others fine and detailed. Using channels allows us to separate these scales and study them systematically.\nSo, these four channels are just one example, but in practice, you could design more channels depending on how much detail you want to capture.”", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

Instead of relying only on what a radiologist can see with the naked eye, we extract hundreds or even thousands of quantitative features from medical images.\n\nFor example, once we outline a tumor on an image, we can study different categories of features:\nShape features tell us about the geometry — is the tumor round, irregular, or elongated?\nIntensity features describe how bright or dark the pixels are, and how their distribution looks in a histogram.\nTexture features capture the patterns inside the tumor, such as whether it looks smooth, coarse, or heterogeneous. These can be computed using statistical methods like gray-level co-occurrence matrices or run-length matrices.\n\nAfter we collect these features, we don’t stop there. The next step is to feed them into a prediction model. This model may perform tasks like selecting the most important features, classifying patients into groups, or predicting outcomes such as how well a patient will respond to treatment.\n\nSo radiomics really bridges imaging with data science. It takes us beyond the visual impression and allows us to mine the hidden information in images, often leading to insights that are not visible to the human eye.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

If you try to separate the inputs using a simple straight line, you quickly find it cannot be done. Linear observers fail in such situations because the data are not linearly separable.\n\nTo overcome this, we use nonlinear observers, often built using neural networks. Here, you see a simple network with two input variables, two hidden units, and one output. By combining the information in a nonlinear way, the network can correctly separate the classes.\nThis idea is powerful for medical imaging tasks. Images are complex — disease and non-disease patterns may overlap, and linear models are not enough to make accurate decisions. Neural networks, however, can learn complicated nonlinear boundaries, allowing them to detect subtle patterns and interactions that traditional methods miss.\n\nSo nonlinear observers represent the next step: moving from simple linear discrimination toward flexible, data-driven models that can capture the true complexity of biological signals.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 64}

I think it’s always good to start with a roadmap, so you know where we are heading. For X-ray imaging, I’ll use this outline format to guide our discussion.\nWe will cover three fundamental aspects: the source, the attenuation, and the detector. This sequence is very logical. First, you need an X-ray source. Without a source, nothing begins — it’s like trying to cook without rice. Next, those X-rays must interact with the human body. If there is no interaction, the photons just pass through like air, and we gain no information. If the body absorbs all the X-rays completely, again, no information escapes. The useful case is partial absorption: different tissues absorb X-rays to different degrees. That difference creates contrast, and contrast is what carries the diagnostic information.\n\nFinally, we need a detector to capture that information. The X-ray photons that escape the body must be recorded so that we can reconstruct an image. So in summary, the imaging chain has three main parts: the source, the interaction with the body, and the detector. Together, they form the foundation of X-ray radiography.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

This was something completely new — it couldn’t be explained without assuming that some kind of invisible physical rays were being produced.\n\nBecause the nature of these rays was unknown, he called them “X-rays.” Later, they became known as Röntgen rays, in honor of his discovery.\nThis breakthrough was so important that Röntgen was awarded the very first Nobel Prize in Physics.

They occupy a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThe part of the spectrum we are most familiar with is visible light, because we can see it with our eyes. But just because we cannot see other forms of electromagnetic radiation does not mean they don’t exist. Think about your smartphone. You don’t see the electromagnetic waves, but you constantly receive emails, messages, and photos from anywhere in the world. These are all carried by electromagnetic radiation.\nElectromagnetic waves are beautifully described by Maxwell’s equations. They are sinusoidal waves traveling through space, with an electric field and a magnetic field that are perpendicular to each other. Together, they form the foundation for how light and all electromagnetic radiation behave.\n\nNow, across this wide spectrum, different portions can be used for different purposes. For example, X-rays are used for radiography and CT imaging. Gamma rays are used in nuclear imaging, like PET and SPECT. Infrared and visible light are used for optical imaging and pathology. Radio waves and microwaves are used in magnetic resonance imaging. So, depending on the wavelength and frequency, each portion of the spectrum serves a different role in medicine.\n\nTo describe the energy of electromagnetic radiation, we use a fundamental relationship:\u000bE equals h times f, which is also equal to h c over lambda.\nHere, h is Planck’s constant, f is frequency, c is the speed of light, and lambda is the wavelength. From this equation, you can see that energy is directly proportional to frequency and inversely proportional to wavelength.\n\nIn medical imaging, we work with very small wavelengths, usually measured in nanometers and angstroms. One nanometer is 10 to the power of minus 9 meters. One angstrom, written as a small circle above the letter A, is even smaller — 10 to the power of minus 10 meters.\nSo this slide shows you clearly where X-rays fit in the electromagnetic spectrum, and why their energy levels make them so useful for medical imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Their wavelengths are extremely small, ranging roughly from one-tenth of a nanometer up to ten nanometers. Within this narrow window, we classify radiation as X-rays.\n\nBut not all X-rays are the same. When the frequency is higher — and remember, higher frequency means higher energy — we call them hard X-rays. When the frequency is lower, corresponding to longer wavelengths, the energy is weaker, and we call them soft X-rays.\n\nDifferent kinds of X-rays are useful for different applications. For example, in mammography, we use relatively soft X-rays because we want sensitivity to soft tissue structures. But if we want to penetrate thicker parts of the body or denser tissues like bone, we need hard X-rays, with energies that can go above 100 kilo-electron-volts.\n\nIn non-medical settings, even higher-energy X-rays are used. For example, in airport security screening, luggage may be very thick or contain dense objects. In those cases, stronger X-rays are required; otherwise, all the radiation would be absorbed, and no useful information would come out. So, depending on the wavelength and energy, X-rays can be tuned for very different purposes — from delicate imaging in medicine to powerful scanning in security.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

That’s why radiography is so important in emergency rooms — it’s fast, widely available, and gives doctors a quick look inside.\n\nBut keep in mind, this is only a projected view.

Techniques such as plain radiographs and CT scans are the backbone of modern radiology. In fact, some of my colleagues and mentors often say: if you had to pick just one imaging modality as the cornerstone of modern medicine, it would be X-rays. If you take away X-ray imaging, hospitals simply cannot function effectively. If you take away any other modality, they can still manage, as long as X-rays remain available.\n\nThere are many reasons for this. X-ray imaging is relatively cheap and widely available. It provides high resolution and fast speed, which are crucial in clinical practice. Another advantage, and one I want to emphasize, is its high geometric accuracy.\n\nWhat does that mean? Think about MRI: it produces beautiful images, but sometimes those images are geometrically distorted. A tumor might appear shifted, much like how a pencil looks bent when you place it in a glass of water. If a surgeon were to rely on that distorted MRI image without correction, they might target the wrong spot. CT and X-ray imaging, by contrast, give you precise geometric accuracy. This accuracy allows us to deliver radiation beams for therapy or guide surgical procedures with confidence.\n\nX-ray imaging is also both sensitive and specific. Sensitivity means that if the disease is present, the imaging will detect it. Specificity means that if the disease is not present, the imaging will not falsely indicate it. So in many cases, X-rays provide a very reliable diagnostic tool. And even when they cannot fully answer the question, they guide us toward which additional imaging modality to use next.\n\nOf course, there are downsides. The most important is that X-rays are a form of ionizing radiation, which means there is some risk. But if the radiation dose is controlled, the risk is manageable. To put it in perspective, a typical CT scan delivers a dose roughly comparable to what you would receive on an international flight, for example, from the United States to China. If you are comfortable taking that trip, then you should not worry too much about a single CT scan. Still, we always work hard to minimize the dose, and over the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in reducing it — while maintaining high diagnostic quality.\n\nAnother limitation is that X-rays have poor contrast for soft tissue. Structures like the brain, liver, or tumors are not as clearly distinguished as they are with MRI. In many cases, we need to inject contrast agents to improve visibility.\nFinally, from a global perspective, the medical X-ray market is huge and continues to grow — billions of dollars worldwide, with steady expansion each year.

At any single instant, you still record just one projection. But instead of stopping there, the X-ray source and detector rotate around the patient. At the same time, the patient table can also move forward or backward. By acquiring projections from many different angles, we collect enough information to reconstruct detailed cross-sectional slices. When these slices are stacked together, they form a volumetric image of the entire body.\n\nSo, while projection radiography gives us a fast overview, computed tomography transforms those multiple views into a three-dimensional representation — a much richer source of information.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

The figure you see here illustrates the essential components.\n\nAt one end, we have a filament, which is usually made of tungsten wire. The filament is coiled so that it has more surface area, and when we pass a strong current through it, the wire becomes extremely hot. This heating process frees up electrons — they become “boiled off” from the surface of the filament.\nNext, we apply a very high voltage potential between the filament, which serves as the cathode, and the target, which is called the anode. The anode is also made of tungsten. The electric field between the cathode and the anode accelerates the electrons at very high speeds toward the tungsten target.\n\nWhen these high-energy electrons strike the anode, their interactions with the tungsten atoms produce X-rays. This process also generates an enormous amount of heat. In fact, more than 99 percent of the energy is converted into heat, and less than one percent actually becomes X-rays.\nManaging this heat is a major engineering challenge. The inside of the tube is kept under a high vacuum so that electrons can move freely without colliding with air molecules. But even in a vacuum, the tungsten target would quickly overheat if it were not carefully designed. The solution is to use a rotating anode. By spinning the target rapidly, the electron beam does not strike the same spot continuously. Instead, the heat is spread over a larger area, preventing the tungsten from melting.\n\nModern X-ray tubes are sealed inside durable glass or ceramic housings and are manufactured with extremely high precision. My colleagues at GE Global Research, for example, have worked on these tubes for many years, refining the design step by step. While the basic principle has remained the same since Röntgen’s time, continuous improvements have made the tubes more efficient, more powerful, and capable of delivering the high flux of X-rays needed in today’s imaging systems.\n\nSo in summary: heat the filament, release electrons, accelerate them with high voltage toward a tungsten anode, and X-rays are generated at the point of impact.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

The answer lies in two main physical mechanisms. This is what I call our first “red diamond,” or key concept.\n\nThe first mechanism is called Bremsstrahlung radiation, a German word meaning “braking radiation.” Here’s what happens: a primary electron beam, accelerated toward the target, passes close to the nucleus of a tungsten atom. Because the nucleus is positively charged and the electron is negatively charged, there is an attractive force. This force bends the trajectory of the electron. Whenever a charged particle is accelerated or decelerated, it gives off radiation. In this case, that radiation is X-rays. Since the amount of bending can vary, the emitted X-rays span a continuous range of energies. That’s why Bremsstrahlung is also called continuous radiation.\n\nThe second mechanism is called characteristic radiation, sometimes explained in terms of the photoelectric effect. In this case, a high-energy primary electron collides with an inner-shell electron of the tungsten atom and kicks it out of its orbit. That leaves a vacancy in the inner shell. An outer-shell electron then drops down to fill the gap. The energy difference between the two shells is released in the form of an X-ray photon. Because the energy levels of atomic shells are discrete, the emitted X-ray has a very specific energy — a “characteristic” value that depends on the target material.\n\nSo, to summarize: Bremsstrahlung gives us a broad, continuous X-ray spectrum, while characteristic radiation adds sharp peaks at specific energies. Together, these two processes explain how an X-ray tube produces the mixture of radiation that we use for imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

You can see that at lower photon energies, the intensity is relatively high, and as the energy increases, the intensity decreases. However, the very lowest-energy X-rays don’t actually appear in the output, because they are absorbed inside the tungsten target itself. Since the radiation is produced beneath the surface, the tungsten material acts as a natural filter, removing the very soft X-rays before they can escape.\n\nNext, at higher energies — around 70 kilo-electron-volts and above, for tungsten — you start to see sharp peaks. These are the characteristic X-rays, labeled here as K-alpha and K-beta. They occur only when the incoming electron energy is high enough to knock out inner-shell electrons, allowing outer electrons to fall into those vacancies and release very specific amounts of energy.\nThe maximum X-ray energy you can obtain is determined by the tube voltage. For example, if the tube is operated at 120 kilovolts, then the maximum possible photon energy is 120 kilo-electron-volts. However, those very high-energy photons are less common compared to the middle range.\n\nFinally, the intensity of the spectrum — meaning the number of X-ray photons produced — depends strongly on the tube current. A higher current means more electrons striking the target, which produces more X-ray photons across the spectrum.\nSo the shape of the X-ray spectrum is governed by three key factors: the filtering effect of the target, the discrete characteristic peaks, and the limits set by the tube voltage and current.\nAnd keep in mind — this will also connect directly to one of your homework problems, so be sure to review it carefully.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

In practice, the cathode is often shaped in a particular way and charged so that it helps to focus the electron beam. Sometimes, additional focusing coils are also placed in the middle region. The purpose is always the same — to narrow the electron beam and concentrate it onto a small area of the anode. That small region becomes the X-ray focal spot.\n\nWhy is the focal spot size important? If the spot is too large, X-rays are emitted from a broad area, and the resulting image becomes blurry, similar to motion blur in photography. A smaller focal spot, on the other hand, produces much sharper images.\n\nThere’s also a clever design trick here called the line-focus principle. The anode surface is angled at some angle, theta. The electrons strike the sloped surface, and X-rays are emitted. Because of the geometry, the apparent or effective focal spot size is equal to the actual size times the sine of theta. This way, you can achieve a smaller effective focal spot while still spreading the heat over a larger physical area. It’s a neat compromise between sharp imaging and thermal management.\n\nFinally, the field of view, or coverage, depends on the distance from the focal spot to the patient. As the patient moves farther away, the coverage widens. The maximum coverage is limited by the anode angle.\nSo, to summarize: focusing gives us a sharp spot, the angled anode helps reduce blur while managing heat, and the geometry of the tube determines how wide a field of view we can capture.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Let me briefly mention a new type of X-ray tube, which represents a more advanced and expensive technology.\nInstead of using a solid tungsten anode, this design uses a liquid metal anode. A thin jet of liquid metal flows continuously downward. An electron beam, generated in a way similar to what we discussed before, strikes the liquid metal stream. The interaction between the electrons and the liquid target produces X-rays.\n\nThe advantage of this design is that the liquid metal can absorb and dissipate heat much more effectively than a solid target. As a result, the system can generate a much brighter X-ray beam — higher intensity and higher flux — without destroying the anode.\nThese tubes are very costly, often priced in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars. We won’t test you on the details of this system, but it’s good to be aware of such innovations. They illustrate how researchers continue to push the limits of X-ray technology, refining designs to achieve better performance.\n\nI should also add a deeper point for you to think about. When we describe Bremsstrahlung radiation, it may sound puzzling: electrons are attracted to the nucleus, so at one stage they seem to gain energy, while at another stage they lose energy. How can net radiation be produced if these processes are symmetric? The key is that the trajectory of the electron is bent. That bending means the electron is accelerated in a new direction, and acceleration of charge always produces radiation. This is the fundamental physical basis — conservation laws and electromagnetic theory together explain why X-rays are emitted.\n\nSo, while the equations provide a clear description, it’s important to connect them with the underlying physics. That’s what allows us to understand not just how X-rays are generated, but also how new designs, like this liquid metal tube, can open the door to brighter and more efficient X-ray sources.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

That knowledge positions you well, not only for deeper research in this field but also for practical discussions, even in job interviews.\n\nNow we move to the next important part of the imaging chain — X-ray attenuation. Once X-rays are produced by the tube, or in some cases by a synchrotron radiation source, we use them to probe an object or a patient. As the X-rays travel through matter, some of them are absorbed, some are scattered, and some pass through with little interaction.\n\nIt’s in this process — the way X-rays are attenuated by different tissues or materials — that valuable diagnostic information is encoded.

If there is no interaction at all, the X-rays travel straight through as if the body were completely transparent. That doesn’t help us, because no useful information is recorded.\nAt the other extreme, if there is total absorption, none of the X-rays make it out. That also gives us no signal.\nThe most useful case is partial absorption, and that occurs through two main processes: scattering and the photoelectric effect. We’ll talk about these in more detail on the next slides.\n\nNow, at the atomic level, here’s what is happening: X-rays are photons, tiny packets of energy. When they strike the body, they may interact with molecules, atoms, or even inner electrons. Some photons pass through unchanged, forming the primary beam. Others are absorbed completely, transferring all their energy to the material. And still others are scattered — deflected in new directions, sometimes losing energy in the process.\nIt’s the balance of these interactions that produces image contrast. Different tissues in the body — bone, muscle, fat, lung — attenuate X-rays to different degrees, which is why we can see structures in an X-ray image.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

At the atomic level, these interactions can be grouped into four main categories.\n\nThe first case is no interaction. The photon simply passes through the material unchanged. You could say the photon gets “lucky” — it doesn’t collide with anything. That photon contributes to the primary beam that reaches the detector.\nThe second case is total absorption, also known as the photoelectric effect. Here, the photon is completely absorbed by an atom. It transfers all its energy to an inner electron, which is ejected as a photoelectron. The atom is left with a vacancy, and when electrons from higher shells fall into that vacancy, characteristic X-rays can be emitted.\n\nThe other two cases involve scattering. In coherent, or Rayleigh scattering, the photon is deflected at a very small angle, but its energy remains the same. Because the frequency and phase of the photon do not change, we call this coherent scattering.\nIn contrast, incoherent scattering, also called Compton scattering, happens when the photon collides with an outer-shell electron and transfers part of its energy to it. The electron is ejected, and the photon is scattered at a larger angle with reduced energy. The energy lost by the photon is taken up by the electron and eventually dissipates as heat.\n\nFor medical imaging, the two most important interactions are the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering. The photoelectric effect gives rise to absorption contrast, while Compton scattering dominates at higher energies and contributes to image noise and radiation dose.\nSo, to summarize: no interaction, total absorption, coherent scattering, and Compton scattering — these four categories describe the essential ways X-rays interact with tissue.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

For medical X-rays, the two dominant processes are the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering.\nScattering can be divided into Compton and coherent (or Rayleigh) scattering. But in practice, coherent scattering contributes only a very small portion and is usually not considered important for medical imaging.\n\nNow, in clinical X-ray systems, we typically operate with tube voltages up to about 140 kilovolts peak, or kVp. When the energy is below about 80 kVp, the photoelectric effect is the dominant interaction. Above 80 kVp, Compton scattering becomes more significant. This is why, in diagnostic imaging, we see a transition in the relative contributions of these two effects.\n\nTraditionally, scattering was treated mainly as a nuisance because it reduces image contrast. But modern research shows that small-angle Compton scattering actually carries valuable information. In fact, subtle differences in scattering patterns may help distinguish benign from malignant tumors. However, detecting and analyzing this information requires specialized techniques, which go beyond the scope of our class.\n\nIn addition to these, there are two higher-energy interactions: pair production and photodisintegration. These processes become relevant only when the photon energy is very high, well above the diagnostic range. For example, in radiation therapy, where high-energy X-rays or proton beams are directed at tumors, pair production and photodisintegration play important roles. In that context, the goal is not diagnosis, but treatment — essentially using radiation to destroy tumor tissue.\n\nSo to summarize: in diagnostic radiology, photoelectric absorption and Compton scattering are the key effects. For therapeutic applications at higher energies, pair production and photodisintegration also come into play.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

But many photons do not follow this direct path — instead, they are scattered in different directions. These scattered photons, especially those from Compton scattering, can expose people nearby.\n\nThat is why radiation protection is so critical. For patients, the exposure is usually occasional — maybe once a year, or only when necessary. But for radiologists and technicians working in X-ray rooms every day, the exposure could accumulate over time if they are not protected.\nTo minimize this risk, we use lead shielding, such as lead glass windows and lead aprons. These barriers absorb scattered radiation and protect staff from unnecessary dose. Without them, repeated daily exposure could become dangerous.\n\nSo, one of the key lessons is that while X-rays are extremely valuable for diagnosis, we must always use proper shielding and safety measures to protect healthcare workers.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

This is a cumulative process: the number of photons decreases rapidly as the beam penetrates deeper.\n\nYou can think of the tissue as being made up of thin layers. Each layer absorbs a certain fraction of the incoming photons. A useful way to describe this is the half-value layer concept. Suppose you start with 1,000 X-ray photons. After passing through the first half-value layer, about half remain — 500 photons. After a second half-value layer of the same thickness, the number drops to about 250. After a few layers, only a small fraction of the original photons survive.\n\nSo attenuation is really a matter of probability: each layer has the same chance of absorbing a photon, and the result is an exponential reduction in the beam.\nIt’s also worth noting that X-ray imaging is not very efficient overall. In the tube, only about one percent of the electron energy is converted into usable X-ray photons — the rest is lost as heat. Then, after filtration and attenuation inside the patient, only a small percentage of the original photons actually reach the detector.\nThat’s why we need two things: smart algorithms to make the most of the limited data, and highly sensitive detectors to record even the relatively small number of photons that emerge.\n\nSo now you have the physical intuition. Next, we will introduce the mathematical description of attenuation — Beer’s Law — which provides a precise model for this exponential process.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

You can think of this region as a pixel, a tiny picture element made of uniform material. The number of photons that enter is what we call the input intensity. The number that comes out on the other side is the output intensity.\n\nThe relationship between the input and output depends on two key factors. First, the property of the material, which we describe using the linear attenuation coefficient, written as the Greek letter mu. Second, the thickness of the material, which we call delta x.\nPutting this together, the output intensity equals the input intensity multiplied by an exponential decay term. In plain language, this means that as the X-ray beam passes through the tissue, the number of photons drops off exponentially with thickness.\nThis exponential law comes directly from solving a first-order differential equation. The idea is simple: if you look at a very thin layer, only a small fraction of the photons are absorbed, proportional to the thickness. Stack up many thin layers, and the result naturally becomes exponential.\nIn fact, this same mathematical behavior appears in many other fields — chemical reactions, radioactive decay, and even population growth or decline.\n\nNow, in the human body, the situation is more complex because the X-ray beam usually passes through several tissues with different properties. In that case, the output is determined by the combined attenuation from all of them along the path.\nThis exponential attenuation law is fundamental to X-ray imaging. It is the mathematical backbone of both radiography and CT, because it precisely tells us how X-ray photons are reduced as they traverse the body.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

For each step, there is a local attenuation coefficient and a thickness. When we add up all of these contributions, we arrive at a cumulative relationship.\nThis summation has a special name: we call it a ray-sum. The term simply means we are summing up contributions along a single ray of X-rays as it travels through the object.\n\nNow, notice what is known and what is unknown. The thickness of each element is something we set in the model. What we don’t know are the attenuation coefficients themselves — those are the values we are trying to determine. So, what we really have is a linear combination of unknowns. That’s why this is described as a linear system.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, you see a logarithm. Taking the natural logarithm is just a mathematical way of undoing the exponential law we started with. This step allows us to link the unknown attenuation values inside the body with quantities we can actually measure.\nThink about it: the input intensity is known because we generate and calibrate the X-ray beam. The output intensity is measured directly by the detector. The ratio of the two gives us a measurable value, and taking the logarithm turns it into the sum of attenuation along the path.\nIf we make the elements smaller and smaller, the discrete sum becomes a continuous integral. In other words, in the limit, what we measure is a line integral of the attenuation coefficient along the path of the X-ray.\n\nThis is the key principle: with X-rays, we do not directly measure the attenuation at each point inside the body. Instead, we measure ray-sums — overlapping signals that represent line integrals. By collecting many such measurements from different angles, we can mathematically reconstruct the image.\nSo this linear equation forms the bridge between the unknown interior of the body and the measurable data at the detector.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Imagine a piece of tissue that is mostly uniform, but with a small bump or nodule inside it. The X-ray beam passing through the normal tissue travels a distance x. \nIts signal is attenuated according to the exponential law:\nA = N naught e to the power of minus μ x.\nNow consider the ray that passes through the nodule. This ray travels an additional thickness, z. Its output is therefore:\nB = N naught e to the power of minus μ (x plus z).\nThe contrast is defined as the difference between the normal signal and the signal through the nodule, divided by the normal signal. Doing the math, we find:\nContrast = 1 minus e to the power of minus μ z.\nNotice that the contrast depends only on μ, the attenuation coefficient, and z, the extra thickness of the nodule.\n\nFor example, if the nodule is 1 centimeter thick, and μ equals 1 per centimeter, then the contrast comes out to about 63 percent. But in real soft tissue, μ is much smaller, closer to 0.2 per centimeter. In that case, the contrast becomes significantly lower, making small nodules much harder to detect.\n\nThis simple example shows the mechanism of attenuation contrast: the difference in signal arises because one path is slightly longer or passes through tissue with different attenuation properties. But in soft tissues, where μ values are close together, contrast can be very limited — and that is why techniques like contrast agents or advanced imaging methods are often necessary.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

That’s why I’ve marked this slide with the largest red diamond.\n\nLet’s begin with the monochromatic model. Here, we assume the X-ray beam consists of photons all having the same energy. That’s an idealization, but it helps us understand the basics. In this case, the incoming intensity, I naught, is attenuated according to Beer's law. The output, which we call I-g, is simply I naught times e to the power of minus the line integral of μ along the path. This means the measured signal is directly linked to the cumulative attenuation along the ray.\nIf you know the input I naught and measure the output I-g, then by taking the logarithm, you recover the line integral of the attenuation coefficient. That’s the foundation of reconstruction in X-ray imaging and CT.\n\nBut in reality, things are more complicated. An actual X-ray tube does not produce a single energy — it generates a spectrum of energies. The detector, in most systems today, does not separate them. Instead, it integrates the total energy deposited, whether from soft X-rays or hard X-rays.\nThat leads us to the polychromatic model. In this case, we must integrate over the entire energy spectrum. For each energy, attenuation follows the exponential law, but the detector sums over all energies together. The result is still a single number — a grayscale intensity — but it is a weighted sum across the energy distribution.\n\nSo, the monochromatic model is simple and idealized, while the polychromatic model describes the true measurement process in clinical CT scanners.

It depends strongly on the energy of the X-rays. In general, as energy increases, X-rays penetrate more easily, so the attenuation coefficient gradually decreases.\n\nBut at certain energies, something special happens. When the X-ray energy becomes high enough to knock out inner-shell electrons — specifically, K-shell electrons — the attenuation suddenly increases. This produces a sharp jump in the attenuation curve, known as the K-edge.\nThis feature is element-specific. Each element has its own characteristic K-edge energy. For example, in gold, the K-edge occurs at about 80.7 keV. That means if the X-ray photon energy just crosses this threshold, gold absorbs much more strongly due to the photoelectric effect.\nThis is very powerful because it allows us to do chemically specific imaging. If we use detectors that can resolve X-ray energy, we can identify where particular elements are present based on their K-edge signatures. This opens the door to material decomposition and even molecular-level imaging.\n\nIn current hospital CT systems, detectors typically integrate over all energies. That’s like measuring the total area under the attenuation curve — you get a grayscale value, but not the details of the energy dependence. However, with modern energy-sensitive detectors, we can directly measure the shape of the curve. That means we can distinguish materials that would otherwise look similar in a conventional CT scan.\nThis concept is especially important for contrast agents. Elements like iodine, gadolinium, and gold nanoparticles all have distinct K-edges. With energy-resolved imaging, we can separate their signals, perform quantitative mapping, and even design targeted nanoparticle-based contrast agents for advanced molecular imaging.\n\nSo the K-edge is not just a physics detail — it’s the foundation for the future of spectral CT and molecular X-ray imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Notice that lipid, water, and bone have smooth curves that gradually decrease as energy increases. Without extra information, their signals can overlap, and it’s very difficult to tell them apart.\n\nBut look closely at iodine, gadolinium, and gold. Each has a sharp jump in attenuation at its characteristic K-edge energy. Iodine has its edge at about 33 keV, gadolinium around 50 keV, and gold at about 80 keV. These discontinuities are like chemical “fingerprints.”\nIf your detector simply integrates all energies, you cannot distinguish whether the bright signal you see comes from iodine, or from gold, or even a mixture of bone and water. But if you can measure the attenuation as a function of energy — in other words, if you can see the shape of this curve — then you can identify which element is responsible.\n\nThis is the basis of K-edge imaging. By designing energy-sensitive detectors, we can separate the signals of different contrast agents. Clinically, iodine is already the most common CT contrast agent. Gadolinium, which is widely used in MRI, can also be detected in spectral CT. And gold nanoparticles are being investigated for advanced applications, including molecular imaging and drug delivery, because of their strong K-edge at higher energies.\n\nSo the key message here is: traditional CT shows only grayscale intensity, but spectral CT can unlock these curves and make imaging chemically specific.

Those are historically important, and I encourage you to read them so you have general knowledge. But in practice, those methods are now outdated. What really matters for us is how X-rays are detected in modern CT scanners and what technologies are shaping the future of X-ray imaging.\nModern detectors are digital. They convert incoming X-ray photons into electrical signals that can be processed by the computer. And today, there are two main classes of detector technologies that you should understand:\n\nEnergy-integrating detectors — This is the technology used in nearly all current CT scanners. They simply collect all the incoming photons and integrate their total energy. Whether a photon has high energy or low energy, the detector just sums them up. That gives us grayscale images — the kind you are familiar with in clinical CT. A variation of this is dual-energy imaging, where two different energy spectra are used to give some limited energy discrimination. Dual-energy CT is already widely applied, for example, to distinguish iodine contrast from calcium.\nPhoton-counting detectors — This is the emerging, next-generation technology. Instead of summing all energies together, photon-counting detectors measure each incoming photon individually and record its energy. That means they can separate photons into different energy bins, giving us spectral information. With this approach, we can do material decomposition, K-edge imaging, and molecular-level X-ray imaging, which we just discussed with gold and gadolinium.\n\nSo, to summarize: energy-integrating detectors are the current standard, while photon-counting detectors represent the future. They promise higher resolution, lower dose, and much richer information content.\nThis transition from energy integration to photon counting is one of the most exciting directions in X-ray imaging research and clinical translation.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

It doesn’t matter whether the incoming photons are high-energy or low-energy — in the end, they are all added together.\n\nNow, this technology works in two modes:\nIndirect mode\u000bIn indirect mode, the X-ray photons first pass through a layer of material called a phosphor, such as cesium iodide. The phosphor absorbs the X-ray energy and converts it into visible light. Each X-ray photon produces many visible light photons. These visible photons then strike a photodiode layer, which converts the light into an electrical current. The current is then read out by the circuit. In this process, higher-energy X-ray photons produce more visible light, but once converted to charge, all signals are summed together. That’s why this method is called energy integrating or sometimes current integrating.\n\nDirect mode\u000bIn direct mode, there is no intermediate light conversion. Instead, the X-rays interact directly with a semiconductor material, such as amorphous selenium. The X-ray photons generate electron-hole pairs in the material. Under a high-voltage bias, these charges are separated and collected as an electrical current. Again, the detector integrates all charges into one signal, which represents the total X-ray energy deposited.\nSo in both indirect and direct modes, the detector does not distinguish between high- and low-energy photons. It simply reports a single number, proportional to the total energy of all photons that passed through the patient.

In medical X-rays, scattering is very common. That means many photons change direction inside the body and then try to reach the detector from different angles. \n\nBut here’s the problem: what we really want to measure is the primary beam — the photons that travel straight along the original X-ray path. These are the photons that contain the true line integral information we need for accurate imaging. If scattered photons are also recorded, they blur the image and reduce contrast.\n\nTo solve this, we use an anti-scatter grid. You can think of it as a sheet with many tiny channels, almost like thousands of pinholes. Only photons traveling in the correct direction, aligned with the primary X-ray beam, can pass through these channels and reach the detector. Scattered photons, coming in at an angle, are blocked by the grid walls, which are made of dense materials such as lead.\nThis dramatically improves image quality by reducing the effect of scatter. Of course, there are trade-offs. If the grid is very tall or tightly spaced, it rejects more scatter, but it can also block some of the primary beam, which reduces efficiency. Engineers must carefully design the grid’s height, spacing, and material to strike a balance between scatter rejection and preserving the useful signal.\n\nSo, in summary, the anti-scatter grid is a simple but powerful device that ensures we measure mostly the primary beam, giving us much clearer and more reliable images.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

That haziness comes from scattered photons that are superimposed on top of the fine structures. Essentially, the scatter washes out important details and reduces contrast.\n\nThink of it like looking out of an airplane. On a clear day, you can see the ground with sharp detail. But on a cloudy day, the clouds blur your view. In the same way, scattered X-ray photons act like a layer of clouds, blurring the image and hiding subtle differences.\nThis becomes especially important when detecting low-contrast tumors. Without a grid, these tumors might be completely hidden in the fog of scatter.

While true multi-energy imaging is still a challenge, they have all developed practical approaches to perform dual-energy CT, which means collecting data using two different X-ray spectra.\n\nLet me explain the main strategies:\nSiemens uses dual-source CT. Here, the scanner has two X-ray tubes and two detectors mounted at an angle, each operating at a different voltage. For example, one tube might run at 80 kilovolts, while the other runs at 140 kilovolts. This gives you two spectra simultaneously, which means excellent temporal resolution and minimal motion artifact.\n\nGE uses kVp switching. In this method, there is only one X-ray tube, but the tube rapidly alternates its voltage between high and low values — say, 140 and 80 kilovolts — from one projection to the next. As a result, you still get two distinct spectra, but collected sequentially.\nPhilips uses dual-layer detectors. Instead of modifying the tube, they modify the detector. The top layer absorbs most of the low-energy X-rays, while the second layer captures the higher-energy photons that pass through. This way, low- and high-energy data are naturally separated at the detector level.\n\nToshiba uses dual-scan mode. In this case, the scanner acquires two full scans of the same patient: one at high voltage and one at low voltage. While this is simpler in concept, it has drawbacks. It takes longer, and the patient may move between scans. Also, if contrast material is injected, its distribution may change between the two acquisitions, leading to misregistration.\nSo in practice, the first three technologies — dual-source, kVp switching, and dual-layer detectors — are more effective. They provide two sets of spectral information within the same exam, which can then be used to separate materials, improve contrast, and reduce artifacts.\n\nThis is why dual-energy imaging is now widely used in clinical practice. It gives radiologists much more information than standard CT and opens the door to advanced applications like material decomposition and virtual contrast imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

It defines the identity of the element. For example, hydrogen has Z = 1, helium has Z = 2, carbon has Z = 6, and so on. If you change Z, you change the element itself.\nThe mass number, often written as A, is approximately the total number of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus. Since neutrons contribute to the mass but not the charge, A is usually larger than Z.\nTake helium as an example. Helium has Z = 2, meaning two protons. Most stable helium atoms also have two neutrons, giving a mass number of A = 4. That’s why you see the helium symbol here written with a 2 at the bottom and a 4 at the top.\n\nSo why is this important for us? Because the way X-rays interact with matter—whether through photoelectric absorption or Compton scattering—depends strongly on both the atomic number and the mass of the element. High atomic number elements like iodine, gadolinium, or gold interact with X-rays very differently from soft tissue, which is mostly carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen.\nAnd this difference is exactly what dual-energy imaging exploits: by probing tissues at two different energy levels, we can begin to separate and even identify different materials inside the body.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

In fact, as the X-ray energy increases, the contribution from the photoelectric effect drops very quickly — that’s why low-energy X-rays are absorbed much more.\n\nThe Compton scattering term, on the other hand, has a more gradual dependence on energy. It comes from what is called the Klein–Nishina function, which describes how photons scatter off electrons. So if you put these two terms together, you can describe the full attenuation as a combination of photoelectric absorption and Compton scattering. Now here’s the powerful part: if we measure attenuation at two different X-ray energy spectra, we can separate these two contributions. Once that’s done, we can predict how the material would behave at any other energy.\n\nYou can think about this in two ways:\nPhysically, we are separating attenuation into its two main mechanisms: photoelectric and Compton.\nMaterial-wise, we are saying that the body can be thought of as a mixture of two basic materials — for example, water and bone. Any other tissue can be represented as a combination of those two.\n\nThat’s the foundation of dual-energy CT: by using two X-ray spectra, we can get material-specific information, not just grayscale attenuation.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Let’s call them spectrum one and spectrum two.\n\nNow, recall that the attenuation coefficient has two main components — the photoelectric part and the Compton scattering part. When we take the line integral along an X-ray path, we can separate these contributions into two quantities. We usually call them A1 and A2.\nSo what happens is this: if we measure the transmitted X-ray signal with spectrum one, we get one equation that depends on A1 and A2. If we measure again with spectrum two, we get a second equation.\n\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns. That means we can solve for A1 and A2. And once we know A1 and A2, we can reconstruct the attenuation coefficient at any X-ray energy.\nThat’s the whole idea of dual-energy CT. By using two spectra, we get enough independent information to separate the photoelectric and Compton contributions. And from there, we can start to do material decomposition — distinguishing water from bone, or even identifying contrast agents like iodine or gold.\n\nSo dual-energy imaging is not just a trick with hardware. It has a very solid physical and mathematical foundation.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Those are what we call current-integrating detectors. What they really do is add up all the incoming X-ray photons across the entire energy spectrum, and then report one number. In other words, they just give us the area under the curve. That means we only get a grayscale image — essentially black and white — where each pixel represents total intensity.\n\nBut imagine if, instead of throwing all the energy information into one basket, we could measure the energy of each photon. That’s the principle of photon-counting detectors. Instead of giving you one number, they break the spectrum into many energy bins.\nSo now, instead of saying “this voxel attenuates X-rays by this much in total,” we can say, “here is how it attenuates soft X-rays, medium-energy X-rays, and high-energy X-rays.” That gives us a rich spectrum of information.\nAnd here’s the exciting part: with that energy-resolved data, we can make not just one grayscale image, but multiple images across energy ranges. \n\nWe can even assign colors to those ranges. The result is what we sometimes call spectral CT or molecular CT imaging, where each material can be distinguished by its unique spectral fingerprint.\nSo while conventional CT gives us one picture in shades of gray, photon-counting CT has the potential to give us multiple pictures at once, even in color. That’s the future direction of CT technology.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

An incoming X-ray photon interacts with a semiconductor material — typically cadmium telluride, or cadmium zinc telluride. This interaction generates an electron-hole pair. Under an applied bias voltage, those charges are quickly separated, creating a tiny current impulse.\n\nNow here is the critical part: in a photon-counting detector, the electronics are extremely fast and sensitive. Each X-ray photon produces its own electrical pulse. That pulse is then compared against a series of preset thresholds.\nIf the pulse amplitude falls between two thresholds — say, between the fifth and the sixth — we know immediately that the energy of that X-ray photon lies within that range. In other words, the detector doesn’t just say “I saw a photon.” It also says, “I saw a photon in this specific energy band.”\n\nWhat you see in this diagram is the circuit pathway: the signal is amplified, shaped, compared against thresholds, and then counted in real time. This entire process happens at the pixel level. And today’s state-of-the-art photon-counting detectors can have pixels as small as 55 microns. Each pixel has its own miniature readout circuit, often called an ASIC — an application-specific integrated circuit. Inside each ASIC are hundreds or thousands of transistors, all designed for high-speed, low-noise performance.\n\nThis is truly high-tech engineering. And the result is not just a count of how many photons arrive, but a spectrum of how those photons are distributed across energy ranges. That is what enables spectral CT — the next generation beyond conventional CT.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

With two basis materials, two measurements are enough to solve the equations, and you can predict the X-ray response at any energy level. That is why dual-energy imaging has been so successful in the clinic.\n\nBut the moment we introduce contrast agents — iodine, gadolinium, or gold nanoparticles — the situation changes. These materials have sharp K-edges at very specific energies. To detect and separate them reliably, we need true energy-resolved imaging.\nThat is exactly what a photon-counting detector provides. Instead of just two broad spectra, it measures photons across multiple energy bins. This allows us to do material decomposition and create chemically specific maps. In other words, we can actually tell apart iodine from calcium, or gold nanoparticles from bone, based on their spectral signatures.\n\nAnd this opens the door to something much more powerful: molecular and cellular imaging with CT. If you attach nanoparticles to specific molecular targets, photon-counting CT can visualize not just anatomy, but biology — at the molecular level.\nOf course, there are additional benefits. Photon-counting improves dose efficiency, reduces beam hardening, and increases spatial resolution. But in my mind, the major breakthrough is K-edge imaging: the ability to map contrast agents and even nanoparticles with chemical specificity.\nThis is why the field is so excited about photon-counting CT — it takes X-ray imaging beyond anatomy and into biology.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

The results demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of this new detector technology, including improved contrast, better noise performance, and the ability to separate materials with high precision.\n\nSo this is a milestone.

With photon-counting CT, we can separate energy information and create maps — for example, iodine concentration maps — directly from the same scan. This means we are no longer limited to grayscale attenuation images. Instead, we can extract quantitative spectral information, detect contrast agents with high specificity, and even generate functional or molecular-level insights.\n\nSo this is not just an incremental improvement. This represents a paradigm shift. We are moving from conventional black-and-white CT into a new era of spectral and molecular CT imaging, powered by photon-counting technology.\nThe field is advancing rapidly, and these first results are just the beginning.

This is a microscopic view of the vertebrate retina — truly an amazing design. You can see the two main types of photoreceptors: the rods and the cones.\n\nRods are highly sensitive to light intensity. They help us see in dim light, but they do not provide color information. In a way, they are like the energy-integrating detectors we discussed earlier — they sum up all incoming light, or in our case, x-ray energy.\nCones, on the other hand, are responsible for color vision. They are less sensitive to intensity but can distinguish between red, green, and blue. In other words, they are like photon-counting detectors — slower, but capable of providing spectral, or energy-specific, information.\n\nSo why does the human retina use both? Because together, they give us a complete picture. Rods allow us to detect faint light with high sensitivity, while cones let us see rich color details.\n\nThis hybrid approach is exactly the idea being explored in modern CT technology — combining energy-integrating detectors for strong, high-flux signals with photon-counting detectors for detailed spectral information.

These pixels give us the spectral information — the energy-resolved measurements that allow for material decomposition, K-edge imaging, and molecular contrast. By mixing the two, we get the best of both worlds: the robustness and speed of energy-integrating detectors, and the precision and specificity of photon-counting detectors.\n\nThis concept is similar to the retina analogy I mentioned earlier — rods and cones working together. The rods give high sensitivity, the cones give color.

Let me explain.\n\nFirst, we have an incoming intensity, N i, and an output intensity, N o. The output is related to the input through linear attenuation. For a single element along the ray, the attenuation is mu times delta x, where delta x is the pixel size.\nWith multiple material components along the path, the incoming intensity is attenuated by the first pixel; the output of the first pixel becomes the input to the second pixel, and so on. Adding these effects together gives the standard relationship. This is a quick review of the earlier module.\n\nThe attenuated output equals the input multiplied by an exponential factor whose exponent is the negative sum of the little mu k values, each weighted by delta x. This is our imaging model or data model.\nWhat is known and what is unknown?\u000bKnown: N i, N o, and the step size delta x that we choose.\u000bUnknown: the set mu k, for k equals 1, 2, 3, …, n.\n\nNormalize by taking a ratio and then a natural logarithm:\n“Natural log of N i divided by N o equals the sum over k of mu k times delta x.”\nThis is a linear equation in the unknowns mu k, with delta x acting as a weight. Because N i and N o are measured, the right-hand side is known after the log. For each X-ray path, we obtain one linear equation. With many paths, we obtain a system of linear equations, often written compactly as A times x equals b. In this algebraic view, the image is treated as pixels, and each measurement provides a linear constraint on those pixel values.\nIf we take the limit as delta x becomes very small, the sum becomes an integral:\n“The integral along the ray of mu of x, d x, equals the natural log of N i over N o.”\n\nSo, in the discrete domain we speak of a ray-sum—a summation—and in the continuous domain we speak of a line integral—an integral along the X-ray path.

Take this as an example: you have a small material element. You know the incoming intensity, you know the attenuated intensity, and because the data are partitioned, you know the total path length. From these three knowns, you can resolve the only unknown, the attenuation coefficient mu—call it mu-zero or mu-one—for that pixel. By assumption, this pixel is homogeneous. With this simple argument, you now know mu for this right triangle. By the same argument, all the right-layer pixels can be directly measured with a prior flow of X-rays.\n\nOnce that is done, move to the next layer, colored green. Use a green X-ray. You know the incoming intensity and the attenuated intensity. You already know mu for the right element, and you also know mu for the current neighbor. Because you know these mu values, you can compute how the incoming intensity is attenuated and thus determine the incoming flux into the green pixel. You also know the attenuated intensity leaving this location. That attenuated intensity is the quantity just out of the green pixel but further attenuated by the right pixel. Using Beer’s law in reverse, you back out the intensity before that extra attenuation. Now you know the value here, you know the value there, and you know the total length, so you can resolve mu for this particular green triangular pixel. Likewise, each of the green elements is resolved.\n\nNext, move to the light-blue ray. At this point, the green and the right layers are known; only this one remaining element is unknown. The same heuristic applies.\nThis argument ties the relations without complicated mathematics. Heuristically, you can peel the image layer by layer and resolve the underlying image algebraically. When you solve the linear system equation pixel-wise, you are essentially doing exactly this: layer by layer. In parallel-beam geometry, you can send all possible rays and reorder them so you effectively view the object from the outermost layer inward, resolving all unknowns layer by layer. This is the key argument.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

You have a cross-section, and you arbitrarily draw lines—these are the X-ray paths. For any such line, we say you can find at least one source position. \n\nWhat does that mean? It means that along this line, an X-ray source sends rays in this direction, so the line integral, or ray-sum, is measured. It doesn’t mean you have every piece of information you might want. It means: if a line intersects the cross-section, then we have data on that line. That is the maximum amount of data you could have, and, under this simple understanding, that amount is sufficient.\n\nThis is the way I understand the subject and how I try to explain it to students.

Right now, I think there are about half a million viewers, a lot of likes, so I really hope your watch gives me a like—that’s good.\n\nSome other heuristics are very important but not easy.

With X-rays, we can measure parallel-beam projections as shown here. Along each X-ray, each datum gives you one linear system equation.

So you need to keep changing theta.\nThe original function f of x, y is converted to a new two-dimensional function p of theta, t. Theta is the angle; t is the coordinate. Using X-ray measurements, you perform a physical or mathematical transform from f of x, y to p of theta, t.\n\nFor example, if you have a bright, small disk, it will trace a sinusoidal curve.

This is a simple case, but the essential idea is already there.\n\nYou have pixel values one, two, three, four—very simple—but you don’t know these; this is just something I set up. What you are allowed to probe is with X-rays. I told you X-rays cannot pinpoint a single pixel. If you had a magic pen that could read out a point one pixel like a photograph, you would not need tomographic reconstruction—that would be too simple.\n\nWith X-ray measurements, we can get some information. Suppose you shoot X-rays this way. As I explained, an X-ray measurement gives you a ray-sum. From the earlier slide: if you do not send X-rays through these two pixels, you will not be able to say what mu one and mu two are. But you do know the sum of these two pixels: mu one plus mu two equals seven. From this, you still do not know mu one and mu two, but you know the sum is seven. Likewise, take a vertical ray: you get mu two plus mu four equals four.\nWith X-ray measurements, you can write a number of equations. Solve the equations and you get the unknowns—that’s the idea. Normally, for an n by n image, you have n by n unknowns. Here, for two by two, you have four unknowns, so you need to shoot four rays and get four measurements: four linear equations, four unknowns. It looks perfect, right? Not that simple.\n\nLook at this: if you shoot these two rays, the first two equations added together give a right-hand side of ten, and the last two equations added together are also ten. So if you subtract one equation from the sum, you get the remaining one. It’s a little tricky, but the point is that these four equations are not totally independent. From three of them you can derive the last one.\nThe trick is that “number of equations equals number of unknowns” only works under the condition that each equation provides new information—they must be independent. If they are not independent, you do not have enough equations to solve the problem.\n\nSo you should shoot a ray along the diagonal direction. Then you may get “this one plus this one plus this one plus this one,” and you will have enough independent equations to solve uniquely.\nAnyway, remember: “number of equations equals number of unknowns” is under the assumption that all equations are independent. Otherwise, you do not have enough equations.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

For a simple case like this, you can solve it directly using an analytic method. But when the number of unknowns is huge—like millions or billions of equations—the direct method will not work efficiently. You may not have enough computer memory, and other issues may arise. So you use an iterative algorithm to solve the situation. Also, the iterative algorithm I’m about to explain lets you impose prior knowledge, like non-negativity or smoothness. These topics are beyond the scope of this lecture.\n\nLet me give you the basic idea—how you can do trial and error to solve a system of linear equations. As I told you, this is your underlying image. You have four measurements—two horizontal and two vertical—and you try to solve this system. The starting point: whenever you use an iterative algorithm, you need a starting point. Here, because I know nothing about the image, I choose a neutral guess and assume nothing in the field of view, so every pixel is zero. This is my starting point, or guess zero. It is a natural and unbiased starting point.\n\nFirst, if this guess were correct, then the vertical integrals must be zero and zero. Based on the assumption, I get these two estimated values: zero, zero. We call this a predicted or synthetic projection. It’s not that you must accept zero, zero just because I say so—you can challenge it. You can say, “If everything is zero, the vertical integrals must be zero, zero.” But the physical measurement says six and four. It is not zero, zero. How do we explain the contradiction?\nWe compare the measurement with the prediction. We see errors six and four—here you measured six but predicted zero, so the error is six; there you measured four but predicted zero, so the error is four. This positive error indicates my initial guess underestimates the pixel values.\n\nAlong this ray, the real measurement is four, but I predicted zero. Clearly, there must be something in these two pixels. Their values should add to six along the first vertical ray. I do not know whether to give more to the first pixel or the second pixel, so to be fair, I evenly divide the error: six becomes three and three. I put the error back. After this redistribution, the two values add to six, so that vertical error is removed. Likewise, for the second vertical ray, four becomes two and two. After this, I am vertically consistent: along the first column, three plus three equals six, and along the second column, two plus two equals four, matching the measurements.\n\nNext, let’s double-check the horizontal integrals. Now the row sums are five and five. The measured horizontal sums are seven and three. Comparing again, the errors are plus two and minus two. A positive error means I still underestimate that row; a negative error means the true sum is less than my current estimate.\nI redistribute the errors: the plus two is decomposed into one and one and added back to the two pixels in the first row; the minus two is decomposed into minus one and minus one and subtracted from the two pixels in the second row. In this case, we are lucky—after this second iteration, we obtain the correct result. Once we reach this state, the vertical and horizontal data are both perfectly explained. We are done—this illustrates the idea.\n\nIn real situations, it is never this simple. You need many iterations and many unknowns go back and forth, and a well-designed iterative algorithm will ensure that after many iterations the solution converges. Sometimes the iterative process gives an oscillating solution, and you need regularization. But again, for this undergraduate-level course, notice the basic idea.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

For example, you know the CT attenuation coefficient, mu, determines attenuated X-ray intensity and cannot be negative. So, during the iterative process, if the current solution gives a negative value, you know it cannot be negative; you force the negative to zero. That is how prior knowledge regularizes the image reconstruction.\n\nThen you iteratively refine the intermediate image, or current guess, one cycle at a time until the outcome is satisfactory.\nHow do you know the outcome is satisfactory? One way is visual—the image makes sense given your prior knowledge. Another way is data consistency—based on your current image, you predict the projection data; if your prediction compares well with the measurement—very close—you say, okay, it is good enough. As far as data fitness is concerned, we are doing a good job.\n\nSo, that is the idea of the first algebraic approach.

This is a different perspective. You shoot parallel-beam X-rays, going this way and that way, and then you get line-integral measurements. What do such measurements do? They act like a probing wave.\n\nIn this case, think of the underlying image not as Albert Einstein or a cross-section of your chest. Think of the image as a summation of many waves. Because of Fourier analysis, you can always do this—you reconstruct a bunch of waves.\nFor example, consider waves propagating horizontally, like the green wave. For any horizontal wave, let me make some comments so you understand why Fourier analysis works nicely. For such a horizontal wave, for all X-ray projections along oblique directions—that is, any orientation that is not vertical—we can say one thing: if you do the vertical line integral, the wave has a positive cycle and a negative cycle that cancel out. The wave just keeps oscillating. So if the projection orientation is horizontal or makes an oblique angle—any degree except vertical—all these ray-sums give you zero.\n\nGetting zero means you get no information about the underlying horizontal wave—except in one direction: the vertical direction. Along the vertical projection, the positive and negative cycles do not cancel, so only the vertical projection gives you critical information about a horizontal wave. Other directions cancel out.\n\nFrom the vertical projection, you obtain information about waves propagating horizontally. And Fourier analysis says the image decomposes into many waves along different orientations. So, to get horizontal waves, you use vertical projections. For waves at one-degree orientation, you need projections at ninety degrees plus one degree—the orthogonal direction.\n\nIf you want to resolve all the waves, you need projection angles spanning zero to one-hundred-eighty degrees. This is the heuristic: you need orientations that probe each wave family. With the horizontal wave superimposed this way, you take the vertical projection; then, if you do Fourier analysis along the horizontal direction, you should recover all the wave information along that horizontal direction. Let me explain this a little better.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

So p of theta—this angle is theta. You get all these projections, and each projection carries wave information along its direction, the X-ray direction.\nThe information carried by this projection profile is waves along the p-axis. This p-axis makes an angle theta. It’s the same idea as before: a vertical projection carries wave information along the horizontal direction. So a projection at angle theta carries wave information along the p-axis, making angle theta.\n\nIf you perform a one-dimensional Fourier analysis, you get the Fourier spectrum. This green profile is the Fourier spectrum of the projection profile. The Fourier spectrum lies along the rho-axis, making the same angle theta. A point on this rho-axis gives a wave whose frequency is proportional to the distance from that point to the system origin. It is a wave propagating along the theta direction, orthogonal to the X-ray beam direction. Along this rho-axis, you have many points; these points represent unique two-dimensional waves propagating along this direction, making an angle theta.\n\nThis is heuristic. You need a one-dimensional Fourier transform to recover a radial line profile in Fourier space. To reconstruct a two-dimensional image, f of x, y, you need all the Fourier information, so the angle theta needs to go from zero to one hundred eighty degrees. When the rho-axis orientation changes from theta equals zero, then one, two, three, up to one hundred eighty degrees, the whole Fourier space is swept by the rho-axis. That means with one projection, you only measure information along one line. But if you change theta from zero to one hundred eighty degrees, all the data points in the Fourier space have been measured—you have all the information. Then you can perform a two-dimensional inverse Fourier transform.\n\nThis is a geometrical perspective on how to reconstruct the image using Fourier analysis, or from a wave-analysis perspective. Just these few things—two slides. I hope you understand these two slides. Then we will take a minute's rest. I will show you my mathematics.\nStep by step, you will understand this geometrical wave argument a little better. OK. I think the algebraic perspective may be easier for you.

It’s a very good one. When I was a fourth-year graduate student, I did a summer job with my supervisor. That summer, I read through his book and implemented the cone-beam reconstruction algorithm. In my view, this is still the best engineering book to explain CT principles. The green textbook explains back-projection, but not as clearly as Clark’s book. To give a better, deeper explanation, we will use Clark’s Chapter 3.\n\nNow the coordinate system is x, y. Draw a line making an angle theta; call this line the t-axis. The projection is defined by the perpendicular distance from a point to the t-axis. The line through the origin at that distance is t. It can be expressed as\u000bx cosine theta plus y sine theta equals t.\nThe unit directional vector along the t-axis has components cosine theta, sine theta. They didn’t draw it, but you can think of cosine theta and sine theta as the two components of the unit vector along the t-direction.\nTake an arbitrary point x, y. Regarding the point as a vector from the origin. Project this vector onto the t-axis. The resulting distance is t. This is really an inner product: one vector with components x, y, and the unit vector with components cosine theta, sine theta. The inner product equals t. As long as t is the same, all points that satisfy this equation lie along the same straight line at a distance t.\n\nYou then do a line integral along that line at an angle theta and distance t. The projection p of theta, t, has two variables, but for a given theta, it is a one-dimensional function of t.\nThis line integral can also be written as a double integral. You integrate the underlying image over the whole plane, and you place a delta function along that line so that only the values on the line contribute. In other words, the double integral with the delta function is nothing but the line integral along that direction. This gives a convenient two-dimensional notation for the projection.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Then you perform the Fourier transform, and you get the one-dimensional Fourier transform with frequency variable w. Here, the two-dimensional frequency variables are u and v. These two are just definitions of the two-dimensional and one-dimensional Fourier transforms.\n\nNow let’s go a little further. Consider the simplest example, the simplest case, and we try to compute the Fourier analysis. Fourier analysis is a two-dimensional function of u, v, but we set v equal to zero. That means we only consider Fourier coefficients along the u-axis—that’s just one line through the two-dimensional Fourier spectrum. Given v equals zero, this becomes a one-dimensional function. So equation seven becomes equation nine. With v equal to zero, you get this part.\n\nRearrange this a little bit, because now the kernel, the exponential function, does not depend on y. So the integral with respect to y can be grouped into the inner integral. You get this part. And you see that the expression in the bracket is nothing but a vertical integral.

How do you get this special-case profile along the single line u? Set theta to zero. You obtain vertical integrals. Vertical integrals give you a one-dimensional signal. You perform a one-dimensional Fourier transform, and you get the spectrum. So you do the physical measurement to get this profile; you perform the one-dimensional Fourier transform; you get the projection profile along this line. In the case I just showed, this line corresponds to theta equals zero, along the u-axis.\n\nIn this way, you recover Fourier-space information along only one line. With an X-ray measurement, you recover Fourier-domain information. Ideally, you want all the Fourier information recovered. Then you perform the two-dimensional inverse Fourier transform and reconstruct the underlying image f of x, y. The Fourier slice theorem is not limited to theta equals zero. The theorem claims that for arbitrary theta, this holds true. For an arbitrary theta, you have an arbitrary one-dimensional projection profile. You perform the one-dimensional Fourier transform and recover the profile along the corresponding line. As explained earlier, if you keep theta changing from zero to one hundred eighty degrees, the line sweeps the whole Fourier space, and you recover all the information. That is the idea.\n\nNow the heuristic: if you have the vertical projection property proved as such, you can immediately understand that the general case must be true. Why? Because the two-dimensional Fourier transform has a rotation property. If you rotate the object by thirty degrees, the two-dimensional Fourier spectrum is also rotated by thirty degrees. Since the angle theta is arbitrary due to the rotation property, you can select the angle as you set up the system. So if you ask, “I have this projection profile; I perform a one-dimensional Fourier transform; will I get the same type of profile along the corresponding line?” The answer is yes. I can select my x-axis along that direction and my y-axis perpendicular to it. In this rotated x–y coordinate, I can use exactly what I explained. Therefore, the Fourier slice theorem must be true. You can understand this immediately from the rotation property of the two-dimensional Fourier transform.\n\nWe can also do it mathematically. We introduce a rotated coordinate system t, s. For u, v, we introduce t, s; and actually this t, s is better placed in the x–y space. So we move this to the x–y plane.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

So you get a line for theta equals zero, a line for theta equals fifteen degrees, a line for theta equals eighty degrees, and a line for theta equals one hundred seventy degrees, for example.

If you know the two-dimensional Fourier spectrum, capital F of u, v, you perform the inverse transform, and you get f of x, y.\nMy motivation is to use polar coordinates. In polar coordinates, you have radial lines in the Fourier space. That radial variable is W—this is really the rho I showed you before—and the polar angle is theta. So\u000bu equals W times cosine theta, and v equals W times sine theta. That is the polar-to-rectangular coordinate transformation.\n\nFor d u d v, the small differential area element, in polar coordinates, you need W dW d theta. The small area element d u d v becomes W dW d theta in polar form. Here, W is the radius. A small angle d theta gives an arc length W d theta. A small radial increment dW gives the thickness. Multiply them together and you get the small area element. This is just your calculus: W dW d theta.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

In polar coordinates, the angle theta goes a full circle, and the radius W goes from zero at the origin all the way to infinity. That covers the full space.\n\nThen we do a little trick. We decompose the full circle into two half-scans: from zero to pi, and from pi to two pi. For the second part, I write theta plus pi instead of just theta. That is why the interval from pi to two pi becomes zero to pi after the change of variables. So you get this form.\n\nFor parallel-beam geometry, the angular range of zero to one hundred eighty degrees is enough. If you scan from zero to three hundred sixty degrees, you simply double the information; you really need only half of it.\nMathematically, we handle this by changing the capital F of W, theta, plus one hundred eighty degrees back to a function of theta. Use the identities cosine of theta plus pi equals minus cosine theta, and sine of theta plus pi equals minus sine theta.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

With this, you only need the angular range from zero to pi.\n\nNext, change W to minus W. Then the radial limit from zero to infinity becomes zero to minus infinity. Swap the limits, and the inner integral runs from minus infinity to plus infinity. Put everything together and you have:\n\u000b“f at x, y equals the integral from theta equals zero to pi, integral from w equals minus infinity to infinity, S theta of w times absolute value of w times e to the j two pi w t d w, d theta; with t equals x cosine theta plus y sine theta.”\nWhere t equals x cosine theta plus y sine theta.\nAll these are just mathematical details—if you get lost, review and you will be able to follow. The key point is that we end up with this formula. This formula is what we call filtered backprojection. If you got lost somewhere, it is not critical; you can review. But trust me for now—through these steps, you get this result. This is filtered backprojection.\n\nWhy “filtered”? Because here you see S of w—the one-dimensional Fourier spectrum along the radial line—and it is multiplied by the absolute value of w. If you performed the inverse Fourier transform without the absolute value of w, you would go back to the original projection profile, the one-dimensional signal you measured. But with the additional factor absolute value of w, the original Fourier spectrum is modified.\nWhen w is small—near the origin—low-frequency components are weighted small. When w is large—at high frequency—the weighting is large. So S of w times absolute value of w is a high-pass filtering: the high-frequency components are elevated in proportion to absolute value of w. After this spectral modification, you perform the inverse Fourier transform and go back to the projection domain. Because of the high-frequency enhancement, this inverse transform is no longer the original projection profile. Instead, it is a modified, high-pass-filtered projection profile. It is not p theta of t anymore; it is q theta of t, the filtered projection profile. That is why we call it filtered.\n\nWhat do I mean by backprojection? \nYou filter first—this one-dimensional filtration—and then you put the filtered values back into the field of view. According to the argument t equals x cosine theta plus y sine theta, for any x, y you retrieve the value q theta of t from your filtered projection profile and accumulate it back over angles. That step is the backprojection process. “Filtration” may be clear; “backprojection” can feel a little confusing, but it simply means smearing the filtered profile back across the image along the corresponding rays.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

The backprojection is visualized. This is the projection profile after filtration, so it is a filtered projection profile. This filtered projection profile, Q theta i of t, is really smeared back over the field of view. Think of this projection profile as being smeared back from this particular direction. You have many filtered projection profiles; you sweep all of them and smear them back over the field of view. Add them together to get the result.\n\nFor a given x, y, what is the contribution from a given Q theta? That is the question I want to explain. Suppose x, y is here. For this x, y—the point in image space—how much contribution do we get from a particular filtered projection profile, here Q theta i? You do this inner product: you get t. Spoken clearly: t equals x cosine theta i plus y sine theta i. That t is the distance between this line and the central line, both perpendicular to this direction, making an angle theta i. For any point along this line, the inner product gives the same t. So, as long as the pixel is on this line at distance t, you retrieve this value from the filtered projection profile. For all points on this line, t is the same. You compute t, you get the value, and you put that value back for any x, y on this line. That value is the same here, here, and here—all along the line. If that value is one, then along that line every point gets one. This is what I call smearing back.\n\nThat was for this theta, theta i. For another angle, you smear back in a different way. The process is linear—the integral means summation. For each theta, you retrieve the value from Q theta, then add it back to the particular point x, y. For another angle you do the same. You can view it like this: from this filtered projection profile, you get the value here; along a different direction, another projection profile gives you another value through that same point x, y. So, heuristically, from the filtered projection domain, any profile is smeared back uniformly, its value covering all points along its line. All projection angles are added in the same way, and then you have the image value recovered. Think about that. I will show reconstructing examples in a few minutes, so you can get a better idea. OKay.\n\nNow, several slides with green buttons are about the reconstruction filter. Here, the reconstruction filter—a high-pass filter—is the absolute value of w. This filter does not have an inverse Fourier transform by itself, because the absolute value of w is not integrable. However, we can introduce a band-limited assumption: for a given projection profile, you have a maximum frequency, a maximum bandwidth W.\n\nSo the filtration really needs to be done with this truncated filter. In the original Fourier space, the ideal is the absolute value of omega extending to infinity. We assume a maximum bandwidth capital W; outside that, nothing is meaningful for the data. With this window, the spectrum becomes integrable. You truncate the otherwise divergent high-pass filter, then perform the inverse transform with respect to this truncated version, H of omega. You compute the inverse Fourier transform as the spatial-domain counterpart of the high-pass filter. You do the computation, and you get this part.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

When you form a projection from one direction and superimpose contributions along that direction, you only get information for the wave components whose directional vector and frequency components lie in the plane orthogonal to the projection direction. \nIn other words, the 2-D Fourier transform of a 2-D projection gives you a central plane through the 3-D Fourier transform of the object, oriented perpendicular to the projection rays.

An iterative algorithm is very useful when the data are not complete—say, some views are missing, projections are blocked by metal, or there are other imperfections in data acquisition. Analytic pros: you don’t need an iterative process; you have a formula—that’s nice. But it assumes low noise and complete data.\n\nSo the two approaches—iterative and analytic—have their strengths and weaknesses.

This basically refers to how you systematically collect X-ray projection data.\n\nIn the first generation, you have a single point X-ray source and a single point detector. Each measurement records one line, one line integral. The setup moves by translation, producing one parallel beam projection in one direction. Then the entire apparatus rotates slightly to a new angular position, producing another parallel beam projection. This process depends on the viewing angle, often labeled theta. That’s the first generation.\nThe second generation improves data acquisition efficiency. Instead of measuring one line integral at a time, you use a small detector array with a narrow fan beam. This detector array collects multiple lines simultaneously as it translates, covering the cross-section completely. Each translation collects multiple parallel beam projections, depending on how many detector shells you have. For example, if you have five detector shells, you get five parallel beam projections per translation. After a small rotation, you repeat this process.\n\nThe third generation further improves efficiency dramatically. Instead of a few detector elements, you have hundreds or thousands along a linear or arc-shaped wide detector array. This is a full fan beam imaging geometry. The detector array continuously rotates to collect data. This configuration satisfies the data sufficiency condition: performing a full 360-degree scan ensures every line through the patient’s cross-section is measured somewhere, so the line integrals are known. This third-generation geometry is still very popular. Modern CT scanners mostly use this geometry but have expanded the one-dimensional detector arrays into multi-row or cone-beam configurations. We’ll discuss those later.\n\nThe fourth generation differs by making the detector array a full stationary ring. Instead of rotating the detectors, only the X-ray source rotates around the patient. The detector ring stays fixed, continuously collecting signals. This fourth-generation geometry solves some mechanical problems associated with rotating the detector array.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 60}

This allows for much faster imaging speeds.\n\nThe driving force behind the evolution of scanning generations is increasing data acquisition efficiency: collecting the same amount of data in a shorter time to improve temporal resolution.\nCardiac imaging is the most challenging application for CT, since the heart beats fast, anywhere between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Tomographic reconstruction assumes the object is stationary, but the heart is constantly moving. So, we need to shorten the data acquisition time drastically.\n\nThe electron beam CT scanner was designed specifically for cardiac imaging due to its high speed. However, it is costly, and image noise is often higher. Additionally, the fourth-generation geometry faces problems with scattered signals affecting other detectors, which causes degradation in image quality.\nBecause of these limitations, the third-generation geometry remains more widely used today, and electron beam CT scanners are now mostly considered outdated.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 60}

Here, you can visualize a diamond that helps you remember the progression of CT generations. The first generation uses a parallel beam, then a narrow fan beam in the second generation, followed by a wide fan beam with rotation in the third generation. The third generation features fan beam geometry with rotating detectors. Beyond that, we have the fourth and fifth generations. The next stages are called the sixth or seventh generation, which involve helical scanning.\n\nHelical scanning is quite an innovative, out-of-the-box idea. Traditionally, with one-dimensional detector arrays, imaging is done by rotating the source around the patient—often a half circle or full circle—to collect sufficient data for reconstructing one cross-section using filtered back projection or iterative reconstruction algorithms. After reconstructing one slice, the patient table is translated slightly to image the next cross-section. This process is known as the “step and shoot” mode.\n\nYou scan one cross-section, then move the patient, accelerate or decelerate the table, perform another full rotation, and repeat. This approach is time-consuming, especially because anatomical and pathological features exist in three dimensions, and patients can only hold still for limited times. Scanning slice by slice leads to low throughput and motion artifacts.\nSpiral scanning solves many of these issues. You ask the patient to remain still, often holding their breath. Then, the table moves continuously while the X-ray source rotates, and data acquisition happens simultaneously and continuously. From the patient’s perspective, the source follows a helical trajectory, which is why this mode is called helical imaging.\n\nHowever, helical scanning introduces data truncation issues. In second-generation scanning, the data may be transversely truncated due to the small detector size. In helical scanning, data is longitudinally truncated because the source follows a helical path within any transverse plane, meaning a full two-dimensional data set for image reconstruction is absent.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 60}

But the actual green helical scanning path deviates from this ideal.\n\nYou measure line integrals only along rays that coincide with this helical path. Immediately, the X-ray source moves out of the plane, producing rays above and below it. To reconstruct a cross-section, say in the XY plane, you need every line integral through this section, including along particular rays such as Ray A.\n\nIn practice, you can’t measure the line integral exactly along Ray A because the source never stays on that plane long enough. You only have rays above and below it. That’s the central data truncation problem in helical CT.\nEngineers found a practical solution. Helical scanning benefits from continuous table motion without stops or accelerations. The patient lies flat on the table, which moves steadily through the scanner. The patient simply stays still until done, making the process fast and smooth.\nTo compensate for missing data, we perform linear interpolation between the upper and lower rays, which are available. The assumption is that the data varies roughly linearly between these rays. This allows synthesis of an in-plane data set, which then can be used with filtered back-projection algorithms. This was the first trial approach.\n\nLater improvements involved helical scanning which uses opposite rays, not just the nearest rays in the same direction. Before reaching a certain position, you could use complementary rays shot from an opposite angle to improve interpolation.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 60}

This technique is called retrospective reconstruction.\nRetrospective reconstruction has a significant clinical advantage.

Given the same X-ray dose, helical CT offers substantially better longitudinal resolution than conventional step-and-shoot.\nThis improvement comes from the inherent capability of helical CT to perform retrospective reconstruction—that is, reconstructed overlapping slices along the longitudinal axis.\n\nIn our papers, we specifically recommended reconstructing roughly three to four slices per helical turn for the best results.\nThus, helical CT not only improves temporal resolution but also enhances longitudinal resolution, so there’s no loss in image quality. This important finding helps explain why helical scanning is so beneficial.\n\nSome believe that you gain temporal resolution with helical scanning but lose longitudinal resolution.

The primary X-ray beam travels straight through a data element, creating the expected line integral for reconstruction.\n\nHowever, during measurement, some X-rays scatter in various directions. You might see scattering toward the right, left, or even backward directions. These scattered photons add a background signal that does not correspond to the direct transmission along the beam path.\nBecause of this scattered radiation, the detector picks up additional signals on top of the real primary X-rays. This extra background leads to artifacts in the image—usually appearing as low-frequency streaking or haze that reduces contrast and clarity.\nIf you correct for scattering components by estimating and subtracting them, you can restore the image quality close to the phantom reconstruction without scatter.\n\nOne common method to reduce scatter is using beam blockers placed strategically. These beam blockers function to block certain parts of the primary radiation, allowing measurement of scatter separately and improved image correction.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 60}

Let me explain this in some detail.\n\nImagine an X-ray beam going through the body in a certain direction, forming a parallel beam projection. This is a real and common setup.\nWhen using a medical X-ray tube and current detector technology, both measure the attenuated signals, resulting in what we call the line integral. However, if you reconstruct the image based on the uncorrected projection profile, the reconstruction may look distorted, often represented by a dotted projection line in diagrams.\nWhy does this happen?\n\nIt’s due to beam hardening. X-ray beams are polychromatic, meaning they contain photons of various energies, forming a spectrum. Initially, the beam may have many lower-energy photons that get attenuated more as the beam penetrates the object.\nLower-energy photons have higher attenuation coefficients, so they are absorbed more readily in tissue.\nAs the beam progresses into the body, the relative amount of higher-energy photons increases because they penetrate deeper. This process “hardens” the beam—increasing its average energy.\n\nSince higher-energy photons are less easily blocked, the beam becomes more penetrating along longer paths.\nDespite this, many reconstruction algorithms assume a monochromatic beam, leading to errors.\nThis results in an underestimation of the linear attenuation coefficient mu because the beam appears to pass more easily than expected.\nConsequently, the computed line integrals and preprocessed data are based on a single energy assumption, but the reality is a changing, polychromatic beam.\n\nThis discrepancy causes characteristic artifacts in images, such as streaks and cupping.\nProper correction methods and models that account for beam hardening are necessary to reduce these artifacts and improve image quality.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 60}

These artifacts are not difficult to understand conceptually, but effectively removing them can be challenging.\n\nIn CT imaging, volume averaging occurs because of finite detector element size and limitations in the reconstruction matrix’s resolution. These hardware elements are not small enough to capture features smaller than the detector size or the X-ray focal spot.\nImagine you have a fine detail—a small yellow cross in an image. But your image pixels are arranged in a grid, and this cross might fall entirely within a single pixel.\n\nThat one pixel will then represent an average of all the structures within it, so the small cross may simply blend into a larger, less distinct area.\nFor example, if the cross is in one pixel and that pixel appears as a light yellow block, you cannot resolve the cross’s true shape.\nThis phenomenon is called volume averaging.\n\nIn CT images, various factors cause blurring and averaging effects, causing images to look less sharp.\nDetector pixels have a limited size, and the X-ray source’s focal spot is not a perfect point but has an elliptical shape, which contributes to image blur.\n\nTo partially counteract this, image processing techniques like deblurring and deconvolution are applied, recovering some lost resolution.\nThis relates to our earlier study of linear systems and convolution in imaging.\nSo, volume averaging is a fundamental problem intrinsic to CT imaging, limiting the spatial resolution achievable.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 60}

The attenuated signal behind the metal may be very noisy or even just noise without a clear signal.\n\nWhen you perform filtered backprojection reconstruction in such cases, the results are often poor, showing streaking artifacts.\nThis happens because the line integral passing through the metal is very long, with many photons blocked or scattered. Beam hardening and other effects further degrade the signal.\nAs a result, the detected signals are compromised with a low signal-to-noise ratio. When estimating line integrals, the data is inconsistent and inaccurate.\n\nFiltered backprojection on such corrupted data generates stripe-like artifacts in the images, which is a typical manifestation of metal artifacts in CT.\nReducing metal artifacts is an important research topic, and multiple algorithms have been developed, though it remains challenging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 60}

X-rays are much more energetic than visible light.

This damage can potentially cause genetic mutations, which are often harmful.\n\nIn the long term, such mutations may increase the risk of cancer or other genetic diseases.\nThere is some debate, though. Some argue that small doses of radiation might even be beneficial, similar to exercise, causing small stress that strengthens the body.\n\nIn this view, controlled, moderate radiation exposure acts like a vitamin, gently challenging the body to repair and strengthen itself.\nWhile that perspective exists in some articles, the general consensus is caution.\nAs CT imaging, especially advanced methods like helical CT for lung cancer screening, becomes more widespread, concerns about radiation dose increase.\n\nPatients receive higher cumulative doses, and this raises public health questions.\nSo, it is crucial to focus on how we can reduce radiation dose and how we measure it in the first place.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 60}

This energy deposited is called the absorbed dose.\n\nThe absorbed dose is a physical measurement of energy per unit mass of tissue, expressed in grays. One gray equals one joule per kilogram.\nThis is the fundamental concept of radiation dose—the energy your body absorbs from X-rays.\nHowever, from a health perspective, the effective dose equivalent is more relevant.\nTo calculate this, the human body is divided into multiple organs or regions because different organs have different sensitivities to radiation.\nSome tissues, like those involved in reproduction or rapidly regenerating cells, are more sensitive to radiation damage.\nTherefore, younger women, children, and reproductive organs require special caution to avoid excessive exposure.\nThis sensitivity is accounted for by weighting factors, denoted by W.\n\nThe dose equivalent, represented by H, combines the absorbed dose with factors related to the type and energy of radiation.\nHigher energy photons or particles generally cause more biological damage per unit of absorbed energy.\nFor example, X-rays, gamma rays, and alpha particles differ in their relative biological effectiveness.\nTo account for this, a quality factor, QF, is applied to quantify the biological impact of different radiation types.\n\nFor X-ray CT, the QF is normalized to one, but other radiation types have different values.\nThus, the effective dose equivalent is calculated using these weighted factors, resulting in a more accurate estimation of biological risk.\nThis calculation is summarized by a formula sometimes noted as equation 1.30 in radiation safety literature.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 60}

Although higher energy photons are more penetrating, they tend to cause slightly higher patient dose.\n\nWhen you reduce slice thickness—that is, make the X-ray beam narrower—you increase spatial resolution. But thinner slices require more photons since the beam is less focused, which can slightly increase the dose due to some photon wastage.\nMany factors affect dose increase or decrease, including patient size or phantom size. For a standard head phantom, the dose at the center and periphery is roughly the same.\n\nFor larger phantoms, like the whole body, the central dose may be lower due to increased attenuation, with a higher dose in peripheral regions.\nIn extreme cases, like imagining irradiating the Earth, the very center would receive almost no photons, so the central dose would be very low, while peripheral areas get a higher dose.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 60}

As the X-rays pass through, they are attenuated—that means they are weakened—depending on the different properties of the tissues they pass through. Dense tissues like bone attenuate more, while soft tissues attenuate less.\n\nBy collecting all these projections from multiple views, we build up enough information to start reconstructing what’s inside the body. That’s the foundation of computed tomography.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 30}

For example, bone blocks attenuate X-rays much more strongly than muscle or soft tissue. This difference is exactly what gives us useful information.\n\nNow, the challenge is that each X-ray image we take is really just a 2D projection. You can see that in the picture on the left. If we only had this single projection, we would miss most of the information about what lies behind or to the side of the structures.\nSo what do we do? We take projections from many different angles—like the images you see in the middle. Each projection adds a different piece of information.\n\nThen comes the key step: we solve what’s called an inverse problem. Mathematically, this is done using the Radon transform and its inverse. By combining all of those projections through the inverse Radon transform, we can reconstruct a detailed image of the body’s interior. \n\nThat’s what you see on the right: a 3D CT reconstruction where bones and tissues are highlighted in different colors.\nIn this class, to keep things simpler, we will mostly work with 2D imaging cases when applying the Radon transform in MATLAB.

This directly affects the radial component of spatial resolution—that is, how finely we can distinguish details along a line from the center outward.\nSecond, the number of views, or the number of different angles, is often denoted by theta. This controls the circumferential component of resolution—how well we can distinguish details as we go around the circle.\nOn the cartoon CT slice shown here, you can see both components: the radial resolution going outward from the center, and the circumferential resolution wrapping around the image.\n\nSo, to summarize: the more rays you use, and the more views you collect, the higher the resolution of your reconstruction. On the other hand, using fewer rays or fewer views leads to blurrier images with less detail.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 30}

A sinogram is just an image that shows how the projections vary as we rotate around the object.\nThis representation also tells us something about the characteristics of the sample. For example, objects that are closer to the center of the field of view show up as regions of higher amplitude in the sinogram.\n\nHere you can see the mathematical definition of the Radon transform. Don’t worry about memorizing the equation—what matters is understanding that it describes how the function f of x and y, our object, is projected along different angles, which we denote by theta.\nOn the left, you see the same setup we discussed earlier, with X-rays passing through the object at angle theta. And on the right, you see an example sinogram. Notice the bright, wavy line: that corresponds to the yellow circular object in the field of view. Because it’s closer to the center, its contribution to the sinogram has a higher amplitude, and it traces this curve as the angle changes.\n\nSo the sinogram is the bridge between the raw projection data we collect and the reconstructed CT image we want to build.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 30}

But to actually reconstruct an image, we also need the inverse Radon transform. This process relies on something called the Fourier slice theorem.\n\nHere’s the idea in simpler terms. If we take the one-dimensional Fourier transform of a Radon transform projection profile at a specific angle phi, that result is the same as taking the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the object and looking along a line at that same angle phi.\n\nThat’s powerful because it means each projection we acquire gives us a slice, or a line, through the object’s 2D Fourier transform. When we combine all these slices from projections taken at many different angles, we can fill in the complete 2D Fourier transform of the object.\nAnd once we have the full 2D Fourier transform, we can simply apply the inverse two-dimensional Fourier transform to reconstruct the original image.\n\nThe diagram here shows this step by step. Each projection corresponds to one line in Fourier space. Change the angle, and you get another line, and then another. As we add up all these lines at different angles, the Fourier space is gradually filled.

For each projection, we take its information and “back-project” it—that means we spread that projection back across the image space at the angle where it was acquired.\nLet’s look at this cartoon example. Imagine we have a large oval, and inside it are two smaller red ovals. If we take a projection from the top down, the sinogram shows two bright spots that correspond to those red ovals. When we back-project this data, we get a blurry reconstruction along that one angle.\n\nNow, let’s do the same from a side view. Again, the sinogram shows two high-amplitude areas, and when we back-project that projection, we get another blurry reconstruction, but this time along the side angle.\n\nAt this point, we have two back-projections. When we combine them, the overlap starts to suggest the locations of the two smaller ovals inside the larger one. Of course, with only two projections, the result is quite rough—in this case, it looks more like two squares.\nBut as we add more and more projections from many different angles, the combined back-projections gradually approximate the true shapes. With enough views, the reconstruction recovers the original sample very accurately.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 30}

We take the sinogram, back-project each view, and combine them. But here’s the problem: if we simply use unfiltered back-projection, the resulting image often looks blurry. That’s because the projections overlap in a way that smears out the details.\nTo fix this, we apply a filter in the sinogram space before back-projecting. Filtering helps sharpen the edges and preserve the fine details that would otherwise be lost.\n\nLook at the images here. In the top row, we have a sinogram and its back-projected image. Notice how the back-projection produces just a fuzzy, grayish blob with poorly defined boundaries.\n\nNow, in the bottom row, the sinogram has first been filtered. After reconstruction, the image is much clearer—you can actually see the circular structure with sharp edges, and even a smaller circle inside it, which could represent something like a tumor.\nOn the right side, you see examples of different filters that can be applied, such as the Ram-Lak filter, the Shepp-Logan filter, and the Hamming filter. Each of these adjusts the frequency content of the sinogram differently, but they all serve the same purpose: to enhance contrast and reduce blurring in the final reconstructed image.\n\nSo in summary, filtered back-projection is one of the most widely used methods in CT, because it gives us images that are both accurate and sharp enough for clinical use.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 30}

Each angle contributes new data to the sinogram.\nOn the right, you see the sinogram domain. Notice how information is gradually added as theta changes. For the square, the sinogram has a symmetric, crisscrossing pattern.\n\nIf you switch to the second phantom—the large circle with a small white dot—the sinogram looks different. The small dot produces a wavy curve in the sinogram because the detector gets closer to and farther from the dot as it rotates.\n\nFinally, with the Shepp–Logan phantom, the sinogram becomes much more complex. There are many structures inside that phantom, and each one leaves its signature on the sinogram. This complexity is much closer to what you would see in a real CT scan of the human brain, where multiple tissues and structures contribute overlapping patterns.\n\nSo the sinogram is really just another way of saying: here’s how the object looks from every possible angle.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 30}

It means lower resolution. If we try to reconstruct an image from this sinogram, the result will appear streaky or blocky, because we don’t have enough angular information to fill in the details.\n\nSo the takeaway is: to get a high-resolution reconstruction, we want a small theta step, which gives us many angular views.

If we only gather projections from 0 to 45 degrees, then when we try to reconstruct the image, we’re missing most of the information.

But if the spacing is too large, the resolution drops too much to be useful. Finding the right balance is part of designing and operating a CT system.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 30}

Later in this course, we will study PET in detail.\n\nI’d like to share a personal connection here.

Let me give you a quick review.\nIn conventional CT, the system typically uses an energy-integrating detector. This means that all of the incoming X-ray photons are combined, and the result is an averaged measurement over the entire X-ray spectrum. That gives us the grayscale images you know well, where tissues appear in shades from black to white.\n\nNow, with more advanced technology, we can use photon-counting detectors. These detectors are energy-sensitive, which means they can record not only the number of photons but also their energies. By sorting the detected photons into many energy bins, we can see the full X-ray spectrum, including characteristic features called K-edges for different materials.\n\nThis approach allows us to separate and identify materials such as gold, iodine, calcium, and fat. In other words, instead of just a grayscale image, we can create color-coded images that reflect the molecular composition of the tissue or phantom. This is called spectral, or molecular, CT.\nSo, with photon-counting CT, we move beyond structural imaging into the possibility of functional and molecular imaging — a very exciting direction for the future.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

This principle is absolutely fundamental.\nJust like in X-ray imaging, we are still working with radiation. But here’s the key difference: in nuclear imaging, the radiation does not come from an external source outside the body. Instead, it comes from inside the patient, because we introduce a radioactive tracer into the body. That tracer emits gamma rays.\n\nNow, gamma rays and X-rays are very similar. Their energy ranges overlap, although gamma rays are usually considered to be slightly more energetic. Both are forms of electromagnetic radiation, part of the same spectrum. Importantly, like X-rays, gamma rays can penetrate the body.\nBut if we simply detect gamma rays without direction, we only get a collection of signals with no spatial meaning. To form an image, we need to know where each photon came from. This is why we use a collimator — such as a pinhole collimator or a parallel-hole collimator. The collimator ensures that only photons traveling along certain directions are recorded, giving us the directional information we need for tomographic imaging.\nAfter passing through the collimator, the gamma rays strike a scintillation crystal. This crystal converts the high-energy gamma photons into flashes of visible light. Next, photomultiplier tubes take that light and convert it into electrical signals, amplifying the signal dramatically.\nThose electrical signals are then digitized and sent to a computer. One measurement gives us a single projection. By collecting many projections from different angles, we can reconstruct a tomographic image.\n\nIt’s important to understand what the resulting image represents. It is not showing us anatomical structure, like CT does. Instead, it shows the distribution of the radioactive tracer inside the body. That means the image reflects physiology — the function of tissues — rather than just anatomy. This is the key and very powerful idea behind nuclear imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Here we see the use of a parallel-hole collimator. The purpose of the collimator is to make sure that the signals we detect are aligned with the holes. That way, any photon recorded must have come from directly beneath that hole, and this gives us the spatial information we need. Without it, we would not know the photon’s origin.\n\nOnce the gamma photon passes through the collimator, it hits the scintillation crystal. The crystal converts that high-energy photon into visible light. Then the photomultiplier tubes convert the light into an electrical signal, which can be read by the computer for image formation.\nNow, notice what happens after a radioactive tracer is injected into the bloodstream. The tracer travels through the body and tends to accumulate in certain locations, depending on the physiology. In this example, for cardiac imaging, the tracer concentrates in the heart muscle. This allows us to see how it penetrates the cardiac chambers and the muscle wall.\nThe resulting image reflects the distribution of the tracer. Since the tracer participates in biochemical reactions, nuclear imaging provides insight into physiology — the function of tissues — rather than just anatomy.\n\nThis makes nuclear imaging highly complementary to X-ray imaging. While X-ray imaging uses an external source and shows structure, nuclear imaging relies on an internal radioactive tracer and shows biological function. Together, they give us a much more complete picture.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

This tracer can be administered in different ways — most commonly through intravenous injection, but in some cases, it can also be taken orally, for example, by drinking a small amount of radioactive liquid.\n\nOnce the tracer enters the body, it participates in normal metabolic processes. As it does so, it emits gamma rays from inside the body. These gamma rays are then detected, and the resulting measurements reflect the distribution of the tracer.\nWhat makes this so powerful is that the signal corresponds to metabolism and physiological function, rather than just anatomical structure. In other words, nuclear imaging allows us to see how tissues are working, not just how they look.\n\nThis sets the stage for us to compare nuclear imaging with X-ray imaging, and to highlight both the similarities and the important differences between them.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

On the right is a PET scanner, which represents nuclear imaging. Although the images shown here may not be perfectly matched, the idea is clear — both modalities use radiation and produce tomographic images.\n\nLet’s begin with the similarities. \nFirst, gamma rays and X-rays have overlapping energy ranges. Their energies are high enough that, when passing through biological tissue, we can often treat them as traveling in straight lines. Of course, scattering occurs, but for image reconstruction, we assume straight-line geometry. That simplifies tomographic reconstruction.\n\nSecond, the data from both modalities can be expressed as line integrals. In CT, this is exactly the Radon transform. In nuclear imaging, it is a related but slightly different mathematical formulation. Still, both methods involve line integrals and support tomographic image reconstruction.\n\nThird, both CT and nuclear imaging generate two-dimensional slices, three-dimensional volumes, or even four-dimensional datasets when dynamics are included. So, in terms of imaging geometry and reconstruction, they share a strong common foundation.\n\nNow, let’s turn to the differences. In CT, the radiation source is external — the X-ray tube outside the patient. In nuclear imaging, the source is internal — a radioactive tracer introduced into the bloodstream. This tracer accumulates in certain regions, such as the heart or tumors, especially malignant tumors with a high blood supply.\nAnother difference is the type of information provided. CT primarily gives anatomical information — structural details of organs and tissues. Nuclear imaging, by contrast, provides functional information, showing how tissues are metabolizing or reacting biologically. This makes nuclear imaging highly complementary to CT.\nThird, there is a difference in flux and resolution. CT uses a strong external X-ray beam, producing high photon flux and therefore high-resolution images. Nuclear imaging uses only a small injected amount of tracer, so the signal is weak. The data are noisier, and the spatial resolution is lower. Nuclear images may not look as sharp as CT images.\n\nFinally, there is sensitivity. CT detects differences in tissue density, but since most tissues are made of light elements, benign and malignant tumors can appear very similar until they grow large enough to change anatomy. That means CT may detect cancer only at later stages. Nuclear imaging, however, is far more sensitive. Because the tracer accumulates in areas of abnormal metabolism, nuclear imaging can reveal very small or early-stage tumors — often before structural changes appear.\nThis sensitivity is one of the greatest strengths of nuclear imaging, making it an invaluable tool for early detection and treatment planning.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

CT provides detailed anatomical information, while nuclear imaging shows functional and biochemical processes. So the natural idea is — why not combine them?\nThat’s exactly what happened with the development of hybrid scanners. One of the pioneers in this effort was Simon Cherry, who helped establish PET-CT as a practical technology.\n\nThe major strength of nuclear imaging is its ability to label many types of metabolites. This makes it highly sensitive for studying biochemical and physiological processes inside the body. The limitation, of course, is that nuclear imaging by itself has relatively low resolution. That’s why it works best when combined with CT or MRI.\n\nCT or MRI gives us the anatomical background — the structural map of tissues. The nuclear tracer distribution can then be precisely superimposed on that background, maximizing the information content. This combination allows us to see both anatomy and function in perfect alignment.\nPET-CT was the first successful hybrid scanner. Today, in oncology departments, it is rare to see a stand-alone PET scanner. Almost always, PET is integrated with CT. This avoids the problems of image registration that occur when separate scanners are used. Moving the patient between machines can change posture or positioning, making alignment difficult. With a single integrated scanner, those issues are eliminated.\n\nLater, PET-MRI was also developed, bringing together molecular imaging with the excellent soft-tissue contrast of MRI. And researchers have even envisioned the possibility of a “tri-modality” scanner — PET, CT, and MRI all in one system. That would give us an even more powerful tool for comprehensive imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

I’ve had to go through these materials multiple times myself. Over time, it becomes clearer — what we are really dealing with are physical and chemical phenomena at the atomic level.\nSo why does radioactivity occur? The reason is that certain isotopes are unstable. These isotopes undergo decay, releasing radiation in the process. The decay can follow different mechanisms, which we will study in detail.\n\nImportantly, radioactive decay follows an exponential curve. This behavior can be modeled mathematically using ordinary differential equations. Once you see the formulation, it’s not as difficult as it sounds.

The mass number, usually written as A, is the total number of nucleons, meaning the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. In most cases, the atomic weight is approximately equal to this mass number.\n\nFor example, in helium, the atomic number is 2, because there are two protons. The mass number is 4, because helium has two protons and two neutrons. When an atom is neutral, the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus matches the number of protons in the nucleus.

When the balance between protons and neutrons is within a stable range, the nucleus remains stable. But if the configuration becomes unbalanced — for example, when there are too many neutrons or too many protons relative to each other — the nucleus can become unstable.\n\nAn unstable nucleus will eventually change into a more stable state.

Let’s look more closely at what that means.\n\nOn the electromagnetic spectrum, X-rays and gamma rays actually overlap in terms of energy. X-rays typically fall within a certain energy range, while gamma rays can extend both lower and higher. In medical imaging, gamma rays are often in the range of hundreds of kilo-electronvolts. For example, 511 kilo-electronvolts is a key energy level used in positron emission tomography, or PET. At lower energies, gamma rays are used in single-photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT.\n\nSo in terms of energy, X-rays and gamma rays are quite similar. The main difference lies in how they are generated. X-rays are produced by electron interactions — for instance, when high-energy electrons strike a tungsten target, generating X-rays in the process. In contrast, gamma rays are produced by transitions inside the nucleus itself. When an unstable nucleus changes from a higher energy state to a lower energy state, it releases that excess energy in the form of a gamma photon.\n\nThis distinction is important: X-rays come from interactions involving electrons, while gamma rays come directly from nuclear transitions. Both are powerful tools in imaging, and as we move forward, we’ll see in more detail how gamma rays are generated and used.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

An alpha particle is essentially the nucleus of a helium atom — two protons and two neutrons bound together.\nAlpha particles carry a relatively high energy, typically in the range of 3 to 7 mega-electronvolts. Because of this, they can cause severe tissue damage. However, they cannot travel far — usually only a few millimeters in biological tissue.\n\nFor this reason, alpha radiation is not useful for imaging. It doesn’t penetrate deeply enough to form images. Instead, it has therapeutic applications. If we can direct alpha-emitting isotopes precisely to cancer cells, they can deliver very localized, highly destructive radiation that kills the tumor while sparing surrounding tissue.\n\nSo, while alpha decay is the first mechanism of radioactive decay we study, it is more relevant to radiation therapy than to nuclear imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

There are two forms: beta-minus decay and beta-plus decay.\n\nIn beta-minus decay, a neutron inside the nucleus converts into a proton, releasing an electron — which we call a beta-minus particle — along with an antineutrino. This process changes the nucleus into a different element. Beta-minus particles can be damaging to tissue, and in some cases, this type of decay is used for therapy.\n\nIn beta-plus decay, a proton in the nucleus converts into a neutron, releasing a positron — which is a positively charged electron — along with a neutrino. The positron does not remain in the body for long. It quickly encounters a nearby electron, and when the two meet, they annihilate each other. This annihilation produces a pair of gamma photons.\n\nThese gamma photons do not emit randomly. They travel in opposite directions, almost exactly 180 degrees apart. This property is the basis for positron emission tomography, or PET. By detecting these pairs of photons and knowing they travel in straight, opposite directions, we can reconstruct images of where the tracer accumulated in the body.\n\nSome textbooks separate positron emission from beta decay and list it as a distinct process. Others group it under beta-plus decay. Either way, the important point is this: for imaging purposes, beta-plus decay and gamma decay are useful, while alpha decay and beta-minus decay are not.

In this case, the nucleus drops from a higher energy state directly to a lower state, and a gamma photon is released right away.\n\nThe second category is more common and more useful in practice. Here, the nucleus does not release the gamma photon immediately. Instead, it first enters a metastable state. After a short delay, the gamma photon is released, sometimes along with other particles such as an antineutrino.\nA classic example of this process is technetium-99m, often abbreviated as Tc-99m. The “m” stands for metastable. This isotope is widely used in nuclear medicine because of its convenient half-life and the gamma photons it emits, which are ideal for imaging.\n\nSo, gamma decay is highly relevant to nuclear imaging, especially in the form of isotopes like Tc-99m, which remains one of the most important tracers in clinical practice.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Instead, gamma rays appear as part of a decay scheme where an intermediate state — called a metastable state — is formed.\n\nA widely used example is technetium-99m, or Tc-99m. It is produced from molybdenum-99, which undergoes beta decay. The daughter nucleus, Tc-99m, is metastable. After a half-life of about six hours, it transitions to the stable form Tc-99, releasing a gamma photon in the process.\nThe gamma photon from Tc-99m has an energy of about 140 kilo-electronvolts. This energy is ideal for nuclear medicine imaging. If the photon energy is too low, below about 100 keV, most of the photons are absorbed in tissue and never reach the detector. If the energy is too high, above about 200 keV, the photons penetrate the collimator and reduce image quality. That is why the sweet spot for imaging is between 100 and 200 keV — and Tc-99m fits perfectly in this range.\n\nThis is why Tc-99m has become the most widely used radionuclide in nuclear medicine, applied in more than 90 percent of diagnostic imaging studies. So now you’ve seen the three main decay mechanisms: alpha, beta, and gamma. In the next step, we’ll discuss the final one — electron capture.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

This happens when the nucleus captures one of the atom’s own inner electrons, usually from the K-shell. By capturing this electron, the proton combines with it to form a neutron, and a neutrino is released.\nThe daughter nucleus is often left in an excited state. To release that excess energy, it emits X-rays or Auger electrons. In some cases, additional radiation is produced through what we call bremsstrahlung — a German word meaning “braking radiation.” This process is similar to what we studied earlier in X-ray production, where electrons slow down and emit radiation.\n\nSo, electron capture does not directly produce a particle like an alpha or a beta. Instead, it changes the balance inside the nucleus and produces photons — either X-rays or gamma rays — along with other possible emissions. This mechanism adds to the classification of decay types, and it highlights again that photons can be generated in different ways. Whether they are called X-rays or gamma rays depends not on the photon itself, but on how it was produced.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The negative sign simply tells us that the number is going down over time.\nIf you solve this equation, the solution is an exponential curve. It looks like this:\n“N of t equals N naught times e to the power of negative lambda times t.”\nHere, N of t is the number of nuclei at time t, and N naught is the starting number at time zero.\n\nNow, the half-life — written as t one-half — is the time it takes for the material to decay to one-half of its original amount. To find it, we set N equal to one-half of N naught in the formula. If you solve for time, you get:\n“t one-half equals natural log of two, divided by lambda.”\nSo the half-life depends only on the decay constant.\n\nBut in medicine, we also have to think about biological clearance. When we inject a radioactive tracer, the body tries to remove it — for example, through urine. That biological process also follows an exponential law, with its own half-life.\nWhen we put both processes together — the physical decay and the biological clearance — we get the effective half-life. \n\nThe formula is:\n“One over effective half-life equals one over the physical half-life plus one over the biological half-life.”\nThis is the equation you really need to remember.

We also saw how radioactive decay can be modeled mathematically. \n\nNow let’s ask the next question: how do we actually produce radioactive tracers?\nOne of the most practical, popular, and cost-effective methods is through something called a radionuclide generator. These generators are extremely important because they are the most widely used way to produce tracers for clinical nuclear medicine.\n\nThe process is often called “milking.” You’ll soon see why this analogy makes sense. We can even describe this process mathematically. It looks a bit more complicated than simple decay, but really, it’s just a system of two equations — one for the parent isotope and one for the daughter isotope.

Instead of asking how isotopes decay, we ask how do we produce these radioactive tracers in the first place? The good news is, this is also easy to remember — there are four basic methods.\n\nAccording to your textbook, the four ways to produce radionuclides are:\nNeutron capture.\nNuclear fission.\nCharged-particle bombardment.\nAnd the use of radionuclide generators.\n\nSo again, four mechanisms for decay, and four methods for production — a nice symmetry that helps you remember.\nAmong these, I want to highlight the fourth method — radionuclide generators — because it is the one most widely used in clinical practice. The first two methods require a nuclear reactor, and while they are very important in research and industrial production, they are not as accessible for everyday hospital use.

Both of these require a nuclear reactor.\n\nA nuclear reactor is essentially a device that initiates and controls a sustained chain reaction. In a typical power plant, this chain reaction produces heat, which is then transferred into a working fluid like water or gas, and eventually used to generate electricity.\nBut for our purpose in nuclear medicine, reactors play a different role — they are used to produce radionuclides. In neutron capture, a nucleus absorbs an extra neutron and becomes unstable, creating a useful isotope. In nuclear fission, a heavy nucleus splits into smaller nuclei, and among the products are medically important isotopes such as molybdenum-99, which is the precursor of technetium-99m.\n\nBetween the two, nuclear fission is more popular today because it is more efficient and cost-effective than neutron capture.

The first method, neutron capture, is less commonly used today, so we’ll focus more on fission.\n\nWhat happens in nuclear fission? The nucleus of a heavy atom, such as uranium-235, absorbs a high-energy particle like a neutron. This creates an unstable excited state. As a result, the nucleus splits into two lighter nuclei, along with a few free neutrons, gamma photons, and a large release of energy.\n\nOn the right-hand side, you can see the process illustrated. Uranium-235 absorbs a neutron and briefly becomes uranium-236. That unstable nucleus then splits into two smaller fragments, krypton-92 and barium-141, along with additional neutrons. Those free neutrons can go on to trigger further reactions, creating a chain process.\nThis principle is very powerful. It’s the same physics behind nuclear power plants and, unfortunately, also nuclear weapons. In our context, though, fission is important mainly because it can be used to produce medically useful radionuclides, such as molybdenum-99, which later decays into technetium-99m for imaging.\n\nThat said, in this course, we won’t emphasize the reactor-based methods too heavily.

It works by accelerating charged particles—such as protons—outward in a spiral path under the influence of a strong magnetic field and a rapidly varying electric field.\n\nWhen these high-energy particles strike a target material, nuclear reactions occur, and radionuclides are produced. One of the most well-known examples is the production of fluorodeoxyglucose, or FDG, which is widely used in PET imaging.\nBecause PET imaging requires very short-lived tracers like fluorine-18, cyclotrons must be located relatively close to hospitals and imaging centers. This is one of the reasons PET imaging is more costly: it not only requires advanced scanners but also a dedicated cyclotron facility to generate the necessary tracers.\n\nSo, while nuclear reactors play a role in producing some radionuclides, cyclotrons are indispensable for producing the positron-emitting isotopes used in modern clinical imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

It provides the right balance of half-life, about six hours, and gamma ray energy, about 140 kilo-electron volts, making it very effective for diagnostic imaging while keeping the patient dose reasonable.\n\nThis approach is extremely cost-effective compared to building a nuclear reactor or cyclotron.

This system operates through a two-step process.\n\nThe parent isotope is molybdenum-99, which is prepared and loaded into an alumina column inside the generator. This column is shielded with lead for safety. Over time, molybdenum-99 naturally decays to technetium-99m, the daughter isotope. Technetium-99m, however, binds only weakly to the alumina column. That means if we pass a saline solution through the column, it will wash the technetium-99m out, while leaving the molybdenum-99 behind. This daily washing process is often called “milking” the generator, just like milking a cow. Each elution provides a fresh supply of technetium-99m for clinical use.\n\nOnce obtained, the technetium-99m is injected into the patient’s body. Inside the body, it undergoes further decay to technetium-99, a stable isotope. Importantly, this decay is accompanied by the emission of gamma photons, which can then be detected by imaging devices such as a gamma camera.\n\nFrom a modeling perspective, this is a two-step decay chain. The parent, molybdenum-99, decays with its own half-life to produce technetium-99m. Then technetium-99m decays with a shorter half-life into stable technetium-99, releasing gamma radiation in the process. Each of these steps follows an exponential law, and when combined, they produce a dynamic interplay between parent, daughter, and final stable product.\nThis two-step process is what makes the technetium generator so effective—it provides a steady supply of a short-lived imaging isotope without requiring a reactor or cyclotron on-site.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

To properly describe the production and decay of technetium-99m, we need three first-order differential equations. These equations track the parent isotope molybdenum-99, the daughter isotope technetium-99m, and finally the stable granddaughter technetium-99.\n\nThe first equation describes the parent: it decays exponentially at a constant rate, as we already studied. The second equation describes the daughter, technetium-99m. This one is more interesting because it has two contributions: one positive term, which comes from the decay of the parent feeding into the daughter, and one negative term, which accounts for the daughter decaying further. Finally, the third equation describes the granddaughter, which only has a positive contribution coming from the decay of the daughter.\n\nIf you look closely, you will see that the daughter equation is not purely exponential—it is influenced by both the parent and its own decay. To solve this type of system, we use standard methods for ordinary differential equations. Specifically, the daughter solution is expressed as the sum of two parts: a homogeneous solution, which describes the natural decay, and a particular solution, which accounts for the contribution from the parent. These two components combine to give the real physical solution.\n\nThe important point here is not to get lost in the algebra, but to recognize the principle: exponential decay chains can be modeled systematically, and by solving these equations, we can predict the time course of technetium-99m production and availability in a generator. This is crucial in practice, because it tells us how much tracer will be available at a given time and when to perform elution for maximum yield.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The solid line shows the daughter isotope—technetium-99m—which gradually builds up as the parent decays. At first, the daughter accumulates rapidly, but eventually, a balance is reached. Why? Because as more daughter atoms appear, they also begin to decay at a faster rate. At some point, the rate of production from the parent equals the rate of decay of the daughter. That balance defines the maximum activity of the daughter.\n\nThis is the key point emphasized in the text: the effective decay rate of the daughter is governed not by its own half-life alone, but by the half-life of the parent. The system naturally seeks equilibrium, so the ratio between parent and daughter becomes constant.\nOn the right-hand graph, you see the practical outcome. Each spike represents an elution, where the daughter isotope is washed out of the generator for clinical use. Typically, this is done once every 24 hours. After each elution, the daughter begins to build up again from the parent, forming another peak. Over the course of days, however, the overall yield decreases because the parent itself is decaying exponentially.\n\nSo in practice, you get this repeating cycle: each day you harvest a certain amount of technetium-99m, use it for imaging, and then allow the generator to recharge. After about a week, the parent has decayed so much that the yield becomes too low, and the generator must be replaced.\nThis is the essence of milking a radionuclide generator—an elegant and cost-effective way to provide a steady supply of short-lived tracers for nuclear medicine.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

This table lists some of the most common radiopharmaceuticals and their clinical applications.

Diphosphonates labeled with technetium are widely applied in skeletal imaging, especially for detecting bone metastases. For the brain, compounds like glucoheptonate or HMPAO can be used to image tumors or measure brain perfusion. Sulfur colloid labeled with technetium allows us to visualize the liver, spleen, and even sentinel lymph nodes. DTPA is useful for renal function and pulmonary ventilation studies. And compounds like sestamibi are used to evaluate myocardial perfusion, making technetium imaging an essential tool in cardiology.\n\nSo what do we learn from this? With just a single isotope—technetium-99m—we can design radiopharmaceuticals to study the lungs, bones, brain, liver, kidneys, heart, and more. This is one of the main reasons technetium-99m became the workhorse of nuclear medicine.\nWith that, we finish our discussion of tracer production. We have seen the different ways isotopes can be generated, particularly the third and fourth methods—cyclotrons for producing positron emitters used in PET imaging, and generators for producing technetium-99m used in SPECT imaging.\n\nNow, we move into the last part of today’s lecture: data acquisition. Here, we’ll focus on two main approaches. The first is the gamma camera, which detects single gamma-ray photons and is central to SPECT, or single photon emission computed tomography. The second is coincidence detection, which captures pairs of gamma photons emitted simultaneously, and this is the basis of PET, or positron emission tomography.\nAs we go through this, keep in mind the difference: SPECT relies on detecting individual gamma photons, while PET relies on detecting photon pairs from positron annihilation.

The first is the gamma camera, which is used in single-photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT. The gamma camera captures individual gamma-ray photons one by one. The second approach is coincidence detection, which is the principle behind positron emission tomography, or PET. In this case, we don’t just detect single photons; instead, we detect pairs of photons that are emitted simultaneously, traveling in opposite directions.\n\nWhy does this happen? Because when a positron encounters an electron, the two annihilate, producing a pair of gamma photons. Detecting these pairs in coincidence allows PET to provide highly accurate information about the location of the annihilation event inside the body.\nSo, in summary, SPECT relies on detecting single photons with a gamma camera, while PET relies on detecting photon pairs through coincidence detection.

I’ve placed a red diamond here to highlight that this concept is essential.\n\nThe very first step in the system is the collimator. Without collimation, gamma photons would be arriving at the detector from all directions, and we wouldn’t know where they came from. The collimator, usually made of heavy metal such as lead, only allows photons traveling along certain directions to pass through. In this way, we can establish the line of response. Only photons traveling more or less straight along the openings are detected, while those coming from oblique angles are blocked. This is very similar in spirit to X-ray imaging, where each measurement corresponds to a line integral along a particular direction.\n\nThe choice of collimator is closely linked to photon energy. If the gamma rays have too low an energy, they will be absorbed within the body and never reach the detector. If the energy is too high, the collimator cannot stop the oblique photons, so the image contrast is lost. That is why, for clinical nuclear medicine, we typically work in the range of about 100 to 200 keV — a compromise between tissue penetration and collimator effectiveness.\n\nOnce a photon passes the collimator, it strikes the scintillation crystal. This crystal, usually sodium iodide doped with thallium, emits a flash of visible light when it absorbs a gamma photon. That flash is extremely faint, so it is coupled to photomultiplier tubes. The photomultipliers amplify the light signal into an electrical pulse.\n\nThen, through a network — sometimes called the Anger logic or Anger position circuit — the system calculates the location where the photon entered the crystal. A pulse height analyzer checks the photon’s energy, ensuring we only accept photons in the desired energy window. Finally, the computer records the position and energy, gradually building up an image of tracer distribution inside the body.\nSo the key sequence is: collimator to select direction, scintillation crystal to convert gamma to light, photomultipliers to amplify the signal, electronics to analyze energy and position, and finally the computer to assemble the image.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

In this case, the object and the image appear at the same scale. It’s simple, robust, and widely applied in routine nuclear medicine imaging.\n\nNext, on the top right, we have the diverging collimator. Here, the holes fan outward. The effect is that the image is smaller than the object. This type is useful when you need to fit a large object, like the entire body, onto a smaller detector field of view.\nAt the bottom left is the converging collimator. As the name suggests, the holes angle inward, producing a magnified image. This is helpful when you want to examine a small organ, like the heart or the thyroid, in greater detail while still using the same detector.\n\nFinally, at the bottom right, we see the pinhole collimator. This works like a camera obscura, creating a highly magnified but inverted image. Because the aperture is very small, spatial resolution can be excellent, but the downside is that sensitivity is poor—most photons are blocked.\nThe key idea is always a trade-off. If you make the holes or apertures smaller, you gain higher spatial resolution, but you lose sensitivity and the images become noisier. If you make them larger, you collect more photons, but the resolution decreases. Designing collimators is therefore about finding the right balance between resolution, sensitivity, and the clinical question you are trying to answer.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

These lenses use bundles of tiny capillaries to guide and refocus X-rays, effectively bending them toward a focal point. The result is much higher spatial resolution, since the rays that scatter off-path are redirected and concentrated at the detector.\n\nYou can see the schematic here: the X-rays pass through the polycapillary optics, and instead of traveling in random directions, they are collected and focused. This technique has already been applied in confocal micro X-ray fluorescence, which allows elemental analysis within a very small probe volume—even beneath the surface of a material.\n\nNow, the intriguing idea is whether similar optics could be applied to gamma rays in nuclear medicine. If we could refocus gamma rays in this way, we might overcome some of the limitations of mechanical collimators, which block most photons and reduce sensitivity. Polycapillary focusing would potentially increase both sensitivity and resolution, opening up exciting possibilities for future gamma-ray imaging.\n\nThat said, this is not part of the standard clinical toolbox—it’s more of a research direction. I included it here to show you that beyond traditional collimation, there are innovative approaches being explored to push the boundaries of nuclear imaging technology.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

But these aren’t ordinary glass. They are specially manufactured scintillation crystals, the heart of gamma cameras.\n\nWhat makes them remarkable is that when an invisible gamma ray photon strikes the crystal, it produces a tiny flash of visible light. In other words, they convert high-energy radiation, which our eyes cannot see, into visible photons that we can detect.\n\nIf you continuously bombard the crystal with gamma rays, you’ll see flashes of light—very faint to the naked eye, but easily measurable with sensitive detectors.

That means the signals are extremely weak. To make them useful, we need to amplify them, and that’s where the photomultiplier tube, or PMT, comes in.\n\nHere’s how it works. When a gamma ray enters the scintillation crystal, it produces a small flash of visible light. That light then strikes the photocathode inside the PMT. The photocathode is a special surface that converts each photon of light into an electron.\nNow, a single electron is still a very small signal, so the PMT uses a series of plates called dynodes. Each time an electron strikes a dynode, it knocks loose multiple new electrons. By the time this process is repeated across several dynodes, the signal has been multiplied millions of times.\nAt the final stage, what started as just one or two photons of light has been amplified into a strong stream of electrons—a measurable current. This current is then sent out of the PMT as an analog signal, which can later be digitized for image reconstruction.\n\nSo the PMT performs two essential functions: it converts light into electrons, and then it magnifies that tiny signal step by step until it’s strong enough to record. Without this amplification process, the gamma camera simply wouldn’t be able to detect enough information to form an image.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Detection is handled by the photomultiplier tubes, but localization—figuring out the exact position of the gamma ray interaction—is accomplished by what’s called the Anger network, named after Hal Anger, who invented the gamma camera.\n\nHere’s the idea. The photomultiplier tubes cannot be made infinitely small, so they are spaced apart. This means a single scintillation event—a flash of light in the crystal—will usually be seen by multiple tubes at once, with some receiving stronger signals and others weaker.\nThe Anger network uses a carefully designed arrangement of resistors, as you see here, to spread out those signals. By analyzing the weighted distribution of the outputs, the system can calculate the event’s most likely position. In other words, the network acts like a mathematical averaging system: if one region receives stronger signals, the center of activity is estimated there.\n\nSo, although an individual photomultiplier tube only gives you partial information, the combination of many tubes together, processed through the Anger logic, gives a precise two-dimensional location of the gamma ray event. This way, every gamma ray photon detected is not only counted but also assigned a position in the image, allowing us to build up a full spatial map of radioactivity inside the body.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The result is called planar scintigraphy. Essentially, this is a two-dimensional projection image, much like a standard X-ray radiograph, but instead of using transmitted X-rays, we are mapping the distribution of gamma rays emitted from inside the body.\n\nHere’s the sequence of events. First, the gamma rays from the patient pass through the collimator, which selects only those photons traveling in defined directions. Next, the gamma photons interact with the scintillation crystal, producing flashes of visible light. Those light signals are then converted into electrical pulses by the photomultiplier tubes.\n\nThe outputs are processed through the position logic circuit, which localizes each detected event in the x and y directions. At the same time, the pulse height analyzer examines the energy of each pulse. This step is important because scattered photons inside the body lose energy, and we don’t want to include them—they would blur the image. By setting an energy threshold, the system can reject those lower-energy, scattered signals.\n\nFinally, the gating circuit can synchronize signal acquisition with physiological motion, such as the beating heart or breathing cycle. That way, the images can be captured at consistent phases, reducing motion artifacts.\nAll of these components work together so that each detected gamma photon is accurately positioned and validated, building up a sharp two-dimensional image of radiotracer distribution inside the patient.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The dominant feature here is a sharp photopeak, centered around the expected emission energy. There are also smaller features, such as the iodine escape peak and signals from Compton scatter or lead X-rays. These arise from interactions within the detector itself.\n\nBut once you place a patient between the source and the detector, the spectrum changes, as shown on the right. Now the clean photopeak is broadened, and the lower-energy region is filled in. Why? Because inside the patient, photons undergo Compton scattering. Each scattering event deflects the photon and reduces its energy. The larger the scattering angle, the lower the photon’s energy when it finally emerges. As a result, the detector sees not only the original full-energy photons but also a cloud of degraded, lower-energy ones.\n\nThis is a problem because those scattered photons don’t carry accurate positional information—they blur the image. The solution is to use the pulse height analyzer. Since the amplitude of the electronic signal from the photomultiplier tube is proportional to the photon’s energy, we can set acceptance windows. Only signals that fall within a narrow energy range around the true photopeak—for example, around 140 keV for technetium-99m—are accepted. Signals that are too low, likely coming from scattered photons, are rejected.\n\nThis energy discrimination is what gives nuclear imaging its clarity, much like how anti-scatter grids improve X-ray imaging. By gating and filtering the signals in this way, we make sure that the image is formed primarily from primary, unscattered photons, preserving both resolution and contrast.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The narrower the point spread function, the better the spatial resolution. Now, what actually determines resolution in nuclear imaging? It turns out there are several factors at play, each introducing its own kind of blurring.\n\nFirst, there’s the intrinsic resolution of the gamma camera itself. This is limited by the scintillation crystal and the electronics that localize the signal. A thicker crystal spreads the light more broadly, and that uncertainty shows up as blur in the final image.\nSecond, the geometry of the collimator plays a major role. Whether you use a parallel-hole, converging, diverging, or pinhole design, the length and diameter of the channels directly control how sharp or blurry the image will be. Longer, narrower channels improve resolution but reduce sensitivity, because many photons are blocked. Shorter, wider channels improve sensitivity but at the cost of blurrier images.\nThird, Compton scattering inside the patient adds another layer of uncertainty. The deeper the radioactive source lies within the body, the more gamma photons are likely to scatter before they escape. Scattered photons are misleading—they point in the wrong direction, lowering contrast and degrading resolution.\n\nWhen we put all these effects together, the total system resolution can be expressed mathematically. Just as when you combine independent sources of random error, you add their variances, here too the variances of the three components—intrinsic resolution, collimator resolution, and Compton scatter—add together. The overall resolution is then the square root of that sum. In other words,\nsystem resolution equals the square root of the sum of the squares of the three main contributions.\n\nThis is the fundamental idea: every component of the imaging chain blurs the signal a little bit, and together they define the ultimate sharpness—or fuzziness—of the nuclear medicine image.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

That Gaussian curve is what you would expect from the use of the camera and collimator.\n\nHowever, once you place the patient between the tracer and the detector, Compton scattering adds a complication. Many photons scatter inside the body before reaching the detector, and those scattered photons broaden the distribution. Instead of a neat Gaussian, the PSF develops a long tail—photons detected in places far from the true source location.\nThis long tail is undesirable because it reduces spatial resolution and creates image blur. That is why we use techniques like pulse height analysis to reject scattered photons, keeping only the primary gamma rays.\n\nSo the main lesson here is: the Gaussian-like PSF represents the best-case resolution of the gamma camera, but Compton scattering stretches the PSF, adding tails and degrading image quality. Understanding and controlling this spread is fundamental to improving nuclear medicine imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

That pulse has a finite width; it takes some recovery time before the system is ready to register the next event. If two or more photons arrive too close together in time, the system cannot distinguish them. Instead of recording two events, it may only record one, or in some cases, none at all. This limitation is called dead time. It reflects the fact that every detector and its electronics need a short period to reset after each event. If the incoming rate of photons is too high, the detector simply cannot keep up.\n\nThink of it like catching candies falling from the ceiling. If they fall slowly, you can catch and count them one by one. But if they start raining down too quickly, you can’t separate them anymore—you miss some. That’s exactly what happens here with gamma photons.\nMathematically, we can describe this with the true count rate, denoted by capital N, which is the number of gamma interactions that really happen. Then there’s the observed count rate, lowercase n, which is what the detector actually records. Because of dead time losses, n is always less than N.\n\nThe system dead time, usually written as the Greek letter tau, can be expressed as the difference between the reciprocal of these two rates:\u000btau equals one over n minus one over N. This formula tells us how much recovery time the system effectively needs between two detected events. In practical gamma cameras, dead time losses are usually not a big problem unless the injected activity is very high—but it’s an important limitation to be aware of.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Unlike CT or MRI, which give us structural information, PET provides functional imaging. It shows us how tissues are working metabolically inside the body. The key is the tracer we use. For PET, the most widely used tracer is fluorodeoxyglucose, or FDG. This is a glucose analogue that is produced in a cyclotron. Because FDG behaves like glucose, it is taken up by tissues according to their metabolic activity. Cancer cells are often much more metabolically active than normal cells, so they absorb more FDG. When we image the concentration of FDG, we are essentially mapping the regions of high glucose metabolism. This makes PET a very powerful tool for detecting tumors and also for evaluating whether cancer has metastasized, that is, spread to other sites in the body.\n\nThe physics behind PET is tied to beta-plus decay. FDG emits a positron, which quickly encounters a nearby electron. When the positron and electron meet, they annihilate, producing a pair of gamma photons moving in nearly opposite directions. These paired photons are detected simultaneously—that’s the coincidence detection we discussed earlier.\n\nThis entire principle—positron emission, annihilation, and detection of the paired photons—forms the physical and chemical foundation of PET imaging. Today, FDG PET accounts for about 90 percent of all PET scans, highlighting just how central this method is in cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The key is that both of these photons need to be detected at the same time to confirm a true event.\n\nHere is how the process works step by step. Each gamma photon first enters a detector crystal. Inside the crystal, the photon interacts and produces visible light, which is then amplified by a photomultiplier tube, giving us an electronic pulse. But not every pulse comes from the correct kind of photon—scattered photons, for example, may have lower energy. This is where the pulse height analyzer comes in. It checks the energy of each detected photon and only accepts those within a narrow energy window around 511 keV. This helps us reject scattered signals.\n\nNow, imagine we have two detectors on opposite sides. If one detector registers a photon and the other also registers a photon of the correct energy, and the two signals arrive within a very short time window—just a few nanoseconds apart—then the coincidence circuit recognizes them as a pair. This means they must have come from the same annihilation event along the line connecting the two detectors.\n\nSo, only when both detectors see valid 511 keV photons at nearly the same instant do we count it as a true PET event. This is what allows PET imaging to trace the exact line of response inside the body, leading to the powerful three-dimensional reconstructions that make PET such a valuable tool in clinical imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

In this diagram, we see detectors arranged around the patient, with a positron annihilation event taking place inside the body. From this event, two gamma photons are emitted in nearly opposite directions.\n\nEach detector continuously records signals as a function of time. Most of the time, what you see are background signals or small pulses. But every now and then, a true gamma photon from an annihilation event strikes the detector, and this produces a sharp pulse.\nThe key idea is that we are not looking at a single detector alone. Instead, we compare signals across pairs of detectors. If detector i and detector j, located opposite one another, both register a pulse at nearly the same instant, and if both pulses have the correct energy—around 511 keV—then we know with high confidence that a true annihilation event occurred along the line connecting those two detectors.\n\nSo, the system continuously searches for these paired pulses. The electronics are designed to be fast and complex enough to check every possible detector pair in real time. Whenever a coincidence is confirmed, the system draws what we call a line of response between the two detectors. That line is where the annihilation must have taken place. \n\nThis principle—detecting paired pulses and building lines of response—is the foundation of PET imaging. By collecting many such lines from annihilations throughout the body, we can reconstruct a full three-dimensional image of tracer distribution inside the patient.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

But that’s still quite a lot of uncertainty—it could be anywhere on that line.\n\nNow, with time-of-flight detection, we can do better. The idea is straightforward: when the two gamma photons are produced, they leave the annihilation site at the same instant, traveling in opposite directions at the speed of light. If the annihilation happens exactly in the middle, the photons will reach both detectors at the same time. But if the event happens closer to one detector, the photon on that side will arrive slightly earlier.\n\nSo by measuring this tiny arrival time difference, we can estimate where along the line the event occurred. Of course, because our timing measurements are not infinitely precise, there is still some uncertainty. That’s why we don’t pinpoint a single location, but instead assign a probability distribution—centered closer to one detector or the other, depending on the measured delay. The effect is illustrated here. Without time-of-flight information, the whole line is equally likely, so the back-projected signal is spread out. With time-of-flight, the probability is concentrated in a smaller region along that line. When you combine millions of such measurements, the reconstructed PET image is sharper, with better contrast and less noise.\n\nSo the concept is simple: coincidence detection gives us the line, and time-of-flight narrows it down to a region on that line where the paired emission happened. This is why modern PET scanners increasingly use time-of-flight technology—it significantly improves image quality without requiring extra radiation dose.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Have you reviewed the slides and the book chapter? Have you reconsidered why the dynamic curve was shown on the previous slide? \n\nWe utilize a generator system to produce technetium-99m (Tc-99m) and molybdenum-99 (Mo-99), and we observe the dynamic range illustrated. I want to underline that the relationship between parent and daughter nuclides is constant—the decay rate of the daughter is governed by the half-life of the parent. This is a core principle in nuclear medicine generators, particularly in SPECT imaging.\n\nThere are three equations we looked at previously. By solving these equations and plotting with MATLAB, you can reproduce the curves and understand the dynamics involved. Normally, we conduct what’s called a “milking operation” at peak activity. This produces the types of curves shown here. So when starting from the Mo-99 source, you continually elute Tc-99m for SPECT imaging.\n\nCan anyone tell me why the decay rate of the daughter, which is Tc-99m, is governed by the decay constant or rate of the parent? Do you see this in the equations, or is there something confusing about it? Why do we have this rate relationship? Here’s a way to think about it: When learning medical imaging, always try to simplify complicated concepts into simple analogies for better understanding.\n\nFor example, imagine parents regularly giving money to a daughter. The parents have a certain amount of fortune and give it at a certain rate. The daughter is very active and immediately spends anything she gets—whether it’s on an iPhone or movies, or travel. So, the parents’ money declines slowly over time, but the daughter always spends fast, as soon as she receives it. In this analogy, the spending rate is governed by the rate at which the parents give money. This heuristic gives us a simple mental picture: the rate at which the daughter “decays” or spends is determined by the parent’s supply rate.\n\nReturning to the technical aspect, if you look at equation 2.17 from the textbook, it may not be immediately clear. But if you break it down and consider the relationship between parent and daughter, it becomes much easier to understand why Tc-99m’s activity is governed by Mo-99’s decay rate.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

If the efficiency of our system is high, and we inject a large dose of radiopharmaceutical, the number of gamma rays hitting the scintillation crystal can actually be more than the system can handle. This happens because the gamma camera needs some time to recover between events. If two scintillation events happen too close together, they can't both get recorded.\n\nThe total dead time, which we call \"tau,\" is given by this equation: tau equals capital N minus small n, divided by small n times capital N. So, let me say it again: tau equals capital N minus small n, divided by small n times capital N.\n\nHere, \"capital N\" is the true count rate, which means how many scintillations actually happen every second. ”small n\" is the observed count rate, so that’s how many the system actually records. If you take one divided by a small n, you get the average time spent on each counted event. If you take one divided by capital N, that’s what you'd have in an ideal system without any dead time. The difference between these two tells us how much measurement is lost because of dead time.\nOf course, what we want is for dead time—again, \"tau\"—to be zero, so every real event is counted. But in reality, as count rates go up, the number of missed events goes up too.\n\nAlways try to use simple ideas to help you understand, and don’t get lost in complicated formulas.

Having a clear mental image is key to understanding any concept well. Now, let’s talk about our outline and what we’ll cover today. We’ll go through single-photon imaging, computed tomography, and positron emission imaging. These are the two main nuclear imaging modalities for tomographic reconstruction.\n\nSo, with single photon imaging, we deal with gamma rays coming from the patient, and with positron emission, we’re focused on positrons. The positron doesn’t stay around for long—it quickly finds a nearby electron. When a positron meets an electron, we use a big word called annihilation, and together they create a pair of gamma-ray photons that shoot out in opposite directions at the speed of light.\n\nSo you have two kinds of imaging. With single photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT, we use single photons—pretty obvious from the name. And with positron emission tomography, or PET, it’s actually two photons created from one positron and one electron. Both types of imaging are deeply governed by statistics.\nAs background, I really want us to review statistical distributions. This part will be brief—just a rapid overview. If you want to dig into details, you can do that later. After the statistics part, we’ll talk about data models. For either single-photon or positron imaging, you need a mathematical model for how you collect data. Last time, I explained the physical concepts and chemical mechanisms, and we talked about collimation. But with formulas, you can actually write computer programs to do image reconstruction based on these models.\n\nSo the data modeling part is about writing down the equations. Given a distribution, what measurements do you expect to see? Once you have a forward model, you want to invert the process. That lets you recover the underlying distribution—the actual tomographic images. Now, these images aren’t anatomical details or structures, but they show the distribution of radioactive features that you introduced into the patient.\nTo do this, we need to compensate for attenuation, and we have two options: deterministic and statistical reconstruction. We’ll talk about those later. Then, finally, I’ll discuss the scanner architecture. You know, in a CT scanner, you have X-ray tubes, X-ray detectors, high voltage, a transformer, a cooling system, a slip ring, and so on—all packed inside the gantry. A nuclear scanner might look similar on the outside, but inside, it’s quite different, and I’ll explain how.\n\nI’ll also mention correction methods, especially scatter correction and how we deal with random counts—how we detect them and remove them. These corrections are much different from how CT works. Finally, I’ll mention a bit about the Fully3D conference, which focuses on advanced topics in medical imaging reconstruction, with an emphasis on X-ray CT and related techniques. We’re organizing that meeting, and it’s a good chance to learn more. If time permits, I’ll show you today’s homework questions and give comments.

The simplest case is the uniform distribution. With a uniform distribution, every point in the interval, like zero to one or zero to five, has the same chance of being picked. Every number in that range is equally likely. That’s one simple kind of distribution.\n\nNext, we have the Gaussian distribution, and after that, the Poisson distribution. The Gaussian distribution, also called the normal distribution, is your classic bell-shaped curve. You usually describe it with a mean—called mu—and a standard deviation, sigma. If mu is zero and sigma is one, that’s the standard normal distribution. Mathematically, you see a scaling factor and an exponential factor involving mu and sigma. This type of distribution is used everywhere in engineering, noise measurement, estimation, and more.\nIf you have lots of independent random variables, each contributing a bit—maybe some are uniform, maybe some are not—when you put them all together, the outcome will tend to look like a Gaussian curve. This is a fundamental result from statistics, and it’s why you see the bell-shaped curve over and over in reality—lots of independent factors add up to give something that looks Gaussian.\n\nThe Poisson distribution is related to the Gaussian, but looks very different, especially with small means. The Poisson describes random variables that give you counts—like one, two, three, and so on—with different probabilities for each count. It’s controlled by the mean, which we call lambda. If that mean is small, you get a very asymmetric distribution. But as lambda grows larger, the curve starts to look more and more like a Gaussian—eventually, if lambda is really big, the Poisson distribution and the Gaussian distribution look nearly the same.\n\nFor the Gaussian, you have mean and variance, with variance noted as sigma squared. For Poisson, both mean and variance are just lambda. You can actually derive the Gaussian by combining lots of individual random distributions—through convolution—and prove it’s a bell-shaped curve.\nSo, in summary, we’re going to see both Gaussian and Poisson noise often in imaging, and understanding how they behave is key to handling measurement and image reconstruction accurately.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

I put a green button on this slide to help you remember the key idea: to understand Poisson and Gaussian noise, you need a good grip on the binomial formula, but also on permutations and combinations. When you have a large number of events, you can use some analytic steps to show that the distribution will approach the Poisson form.\n\nFor example, in gamma-ray emission—whether it’s single gamma-ray emission or paired photons—the process follows the Poisson distribution model, which uses the parameter lambda. So what does this mean in practice? Let’s say you’re counting gamma-ray photons during a scan. The whole time period gets cut into many small intervals. In each tiny interval, the probability that you get a photon is small, call that P, and the probability that you don’t is Q, which is just one minus P. Whether you get a photon or not in any interval is random; there’s no way to predict it exactly.\n\nThis randomness is at the heart of nuclear physics. The emission is not deterministic—it just follows probabilities. Einstein famously said, “God does not play dice,” but some would argue that God indeed lets randomness play a role in the universe. In our context, the emission of gamma-ray photons is governed by pure chance, following the Poisson distribution. When you zoom in to those tiny intervals, you’re really dealing with just the possibility—P or Q—of a gamma-ray being emitted, and it’s entirely a game of probability.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

But most common X-ray detectors are still current-based or energy-integrating types. In traditional X-ray detection, besides Poisson noise, you also get electronic noise from the semiconductor detector design. That electronic noise is modeled by the Gaussian distribution.\n\nSo for X-ray CT data acquisition, the full statistical model is actually a combination—Poisson noise plus Gaussian noise.

For nuclear emission, the energy of gamma-ray photons is usually in the range of about 60 to 600 keV, and most importantly, about ninety percent of applications use the isotope technetium-99m. This isotope, Tc-99m, has an energy of 140 keV. Now, keep that number in mind—sometimes I forget, but it’s 140 keV, just a little higher than the energy used for X-rays. X-ray energy is usually between 80 keV and up to around 130 keV, so this radiotracer energy is actually quite comparable to the X-ray photon energy range. Now, for positron emission, you’ll notice in the homework there's a question about the gamma-ray energy produced by positron emission. The answer is 511 keV, which is much higher.\n\nFor single photon emission, here’s how we model it. Let’s say the source is at position \"a.\" At location \"a\" in the body, you have a certain amount of radiotracer—a concentration or count of radioactive atoms—denoted as N(a). You collimate the gamma-ray flux at this spot, and you look down that line to see how much signal flows toward the detector. Now, the gamma-ray can be emitted in any direction, so a scaling factor is applied, proportional to the size of that mechanical collimator. At the detector, you measure how many gamma-ray photons you can receive.\n\nIf the gamma-ray source were in a vacuum, you’d get just your initial concentration, scaled by the geometric factor—that’s determined by how big the collimator opening is. In reality, the radiotracer is inside the human body, so the photons move from \"a\" toward the gamma camera detector at position \"d.\" Along the way, the photons encounter tissue and undergo attenuation. For gamma-ray photons at 140 keV, their energy is just above the high end used for CT x-rays, but the physics is similar—they’re tiny waves.\nThe formula you see uses an exponential factor, e to the negative integral from \"a\" to \"d\" of mu(s) ds. Here, mu is the attenuation coefficient, which depends on position in the body. This exponential term describes how the signal from the source gets weighted by attenuation—it's a line integral, but not a full line like in CT, more of a partial line integral. This is what makes SPECT reconstruction different from X-ray CT reconstruction—so this data model is straightforward but very important.\n\nNow, let’s look at paired photon emission. Here, an event occurs: a positron is emitted, finds a nearby electron, and annihilates. That results in two gamma-ray photons flying off in opposite directions. One gamma-ray photon travels from position \"a\" to detector d1, the other goes from \"a\" to detector d2. Both photons are attenuated along their paths. The attenuation factor for each path acts like a probability—the chance that the photon actually reaches the detector.\nFor a paired event to be registered, both photons have to hit their detectors at the same time—so the total probability is the product of two individual probabilities. Both exponential attenuation factors multiply together, so in the exponent, you just add up the two integrals—from d1 to a, and from a to d2. Together, these cover the entire path from d1 to d2, resulting in a traditional line integral. And the nice thing is, this line integral does not depend on the original source position \"a\"—it's only about the line between d1 and d2.\n\nSo, you have two models here: one where the weighting depends on the source location, and one where the weighting—the response along the line—remains constant, regardless of where the gamma source is. For paired photon events, the formula has constant weight; for single photon events, the weight changes based on where the radiotracer is located. And if the radiotracer moves, the weighting factor changes with it. Any questions?", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

You’ll notice I put a green button here, and what I want to show is how you can eliminate the location dependence—meaning the weighting factor no longer depends on the source position \"a.\"\n\nWhen you have two factors, each one representing a probability, you multiply them together. The source position cancels out in the exponent when you do this multiplication. You can actually apply this same concept to SPECT imaging. In SPECT, which uses single photon emission, if you put detectors on both sides and take two measurements—one on each side—you can multiply those measurements together.\n\nWhen you multiply the measured signals, you end up with the concentration of the radiotracer squared—it appears as a square here because you measured along both paths. Technically, you’re combining two partial attenuation factors: one from \"a\" to detector d1, and one from \"a\" to detector d2. When you multiply them, the exponentials add up, and the weighting factor becomes constant with respect to the source location.\n\nSo it seems, at first glance, like SPECT imaging can have a constant weighting factor for these combined measurements, just like paired photon emission in PET, which already has constant weighting. But, be careful—real life is not always this simple. There are practical limitations and differences in how signals behave, so always question whether these theoretical simplifications hold up in practice.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

But when you have two sources, or more specifically, two gamma resources, things get complicated. If you try to multiply the measurements, like I showed on the previous slide, you end up expanding two terms from each measurement. That gives you four terms in total.\n\nThe first two terms are nice—they give you a constant weighting factor, and the line integral of the concentrations squared. That part would make things look easy, as long as the weighting factor stays constant. But the problem is, you also get cross-product terms when expanding. These cross terms involve measurements from one source to the detector, multiplied by measurements from the second source to the other detector, so you get combinations like from d1 to a and from d2 to b, where a and b are different source positions.\n\nThese cross terms are messy and make modeling in SPECT much more complicated. The cross terms mean the data model for SPECT includes weighting factors that still depend on the source positions, even when you know the attenuation background. This partial attenuation messes up the tidy modeling you get with paired photon events in PET; for PET or paired emission, the modeling is straightforward, and you get constant weighting.

In previous slides, I mentioned how, when you measure along a longer line, you need to take account of the location, but for PET, you measure all coincident detections. Effectively, you sum or integrate all the individual concentrations, called lambda. The important point is that the attenuation factor remains constant—it doesn’t depend on the source position, so it can be factored out.\n\nIf the attenuation coefficient, mu, is known, then it becomes an unknown factor in your measurements. But once you know mu—like if you assume the patient’s body is mostly water, making mu equal to the value for water, or if you measure mu with a dedicated transmission scan—you can normalize your measurements, and you end up with a clean line integral. With lots of gamma photons, the measurements really do reflect the mean, and you can use deterministic reconstruction, like filtered backprojection.\n\nIf you know mu from a special transmission scan or by assuming it’s the value for water, then your reconstruction is straightforward. An interesting twist is the time-of-flight approach, which uses the difference in arrival times of photons at the detectors to estimate where the annihilation occurred. By measuring these time differences, you can gain additional information about where the event happened—close to one detector or the other. This time-of-flight technique is advanced, and although we don’t have time to fully cover it here, just know it’s one way to estimate mu and improve PET reconstructions.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

When you want to measure the attenuation coefficient, or mu, for PET, you often use an individual CT scan to map out the mu distribution inside the patient’s body.\n\nBut here’s a key point: the photon energy in PET is much different from CT. PET uses gamma photons at 511 keV, while X-ray CT scans use tube voltages that go up to about 140 kVp. The actual X-ray beam covers a spectrum from around 30 keV to 140 keV, but all these energies can be summed up as a single effective energy, usually around 70 keV. So, when you measure attenuation with CT, the coefficient you get is really for that effective energy, about 70 keV.\n\nFor PET attenuation correction, you need the mu value at 511 keV, because those more energetic gamma photons interact differently with tissue. To bridge this gap, you use a piecewise linear mapping. That means for any CT-measured attenuation coefficient at 70 keV, you estimate the corresponding coefficient for PET at 511 keV. This mapping follows a pretty reliable, piecewise linear relationship: tissues that have low attenuation at CT energies also have low attenuation at PET energies, and vice versa.\n\nWhy do we combine PET and CT? The CT scan provides anatomical structure, while the PET scan gives functional information. Having both types of data in a single framework is powerful—you get two kinds of complementary information. But beyond that, CT also provides the key information needed for attenuation correction in PET. With the mu values from CT, you can calculate the scaling factor, making it possible to convert PET data into proper line integrals for accurate image reconstruction.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Quantitative information can be extracted this way.\n\nLike I said here, the PET result without attenuation correction shows a very dark side. But when you apply the correct attenuation coefficient, you see a much more uniform appearance. The result is more accurate for concentrations—for example, in the liver—making the measurements statistically meaningful. That’s one reason I covered the deterministic reconstruction process first. Now I’m giving you a high-level idea about statistical reconstruction. So, if you have lambda—capital lambda—as the image to be estimated, here’s how the statistical approach works. We are given noisy measurements, and we want to estimate the image from those measurements. The measured quantity, called q, is what actually comes from the system, whether you use mechanical collimators or coincidence detection. The measurement is very noisy because the gamma-ray tracer concentration isn’t perfect, and the decay rate is reasonable, but the noise is not normal anymore. It’s not the normal noise you see in CT reconstruction. The underlying source distribution can be modeled statistically; the image represents the source distribution, broken down into small pixels, where each pixel acts like a small light bulb.\n\nSo far, we’ve talked about image reconstruction for both SPECT and PET. This assumes your data model is good enough—meaning you have a large number of gamma photons captured. In that situation, the measurements reflect the actual statistical mean, so you get a formula—the data model.\nThe data model is tricky for single photon emission and different for paired photon emission because the weighting factor changes. For single photon emission, the weighting factor fundamentally depends on the location of the active source element. The weighting factor always depends on location.\nI explained that this location dependence cannot be easily removed. When you try to multiply paired measurements together, cross terms appear and you can't easily get rid of the spatial dependence.\n\nBut for PET photon emission, you’re actually able to account for the single source distribution, with a probability factor in the formula. If you have multiple radioactive source points along the same line, you just form the line integral by adding them up. The attenuation factor for any radioactive element along that line is the same.\nSo you can factor it out. As long as you know mu—the attenuation coefficient—you know the attenuation factor, and you get a neat line integral. Then you use filtered back projection, just like in CT. This is a very nice feature for image reconstruction. If you haven’t got the point yet, review the slides—I’ve been busy these past few days and haven’t uploaded this part yet, but I’ll refine it and upload it soon. It’s important to review the slides and follow the argument—this way, you’ll truly understand the data model for SPECT and PET. That’s key. Once you know the model, for PET in particular, you can use filtered back projection.\n\nThat’s why nuclear tomography comes after CT, because you need to have some background knowledge from CT. For SPECT imaging, you have a location-dependent attenuation factor. But if you know mu, and if you measure it—like in an individual transmission scan—you can still convert it into the attenuation rate for your data.\nYou can turn each measurement into something that forms a line integral—a sum. Then you’ll have a system of linear equations, which is just like CT—a system of linear equations to solve. You can use a real high-performance computer for this. Linear algebra gives you the tools to measure and solve these equations, and we know how to do that both numerically and analytically.\n\nBut what happens if you don’t have enough flux? That’s a big problem. I mentioned it the other day: X-ray flux is high, but for nuclear imaging, it’s much lower. That’s because you’re introducing radioisotopes. The number of emitted gamma-ray photons isn’t ideal, because you don’t want to introduce too much radioactive material into the human body. You need to use the minimum amount for safety. On the other hand, radioisotopes are incredibly sensitive. Any signal you detect comes from the radioisotopes, so you get very high sensitivity.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The underlying framework is a plasma model. Consider an image made up of pixels. Each pixel, along with its neighbors, contributes independently—meaning the measurement at one pixel does not directly depend on another. To capture this mathematically, we partition time into small intervals—for example, 10 milliseconds each. One interval, the next interval, and another further away all behave independently. This independence is crucial because it allows us to express the probability of the entire measurement as the product of many small probabilities. Each detector, each pixel, each time interval contributes its own probability, and multiplying them together gives the overall likelihood.\n\nThis setup naturally leads to probabilistic modeling. Bayes’ rule, which many of us first learned in high school, becomes central here. Imagine a patient comes in, and we perform data acquisition using a camera or a PET scanner. The raw measurements are then organized into sinograms in 2D or 3D. To understand error and uncertainty, we rely on the power of mathematical notation, which is both compact and expressive. In fact, the measured counts can be modeled as random variables following a Poisson distribution. The problem can then be phrased as: given the measured data, what is the most likely underlying image, denoted by capital lambda (Λ)?\nThis probability depends on several factors. First, assume the true image is known, along with the source distribution and any background activity. If we also know the imaging geometry, then we can predict what each detector should record. For example, a detector may be expected to receive around 3,000 gamma photons during a five-minute scan. The difficulty is that in reality, the image is not known—we only have the measured data. That’s why we must also consider prior knowledge about the image distribution. For younger patients without cancer, we may expect little to no radioactive uptake in major organs. For older patients, there may be a higher probability of uptake, for instance, in the colon if there is a tumor. These expectations form a prior distribution on the image.\n\nHowever, in many cases, especially when data is scarce, we may not want to assume anything specific. In that case, we take the prior distribution to be uniform, meaning every image is equally likely. This constant prior does not affect the statistical estimation, since it cancels out in maximization.\nFrom here, two key concepts arise: maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation and maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. MAP seeks the image that maximizes the posterior probability, combining both the likelihood of the measured data given the image and the prior probability of the image itself. If we assume the prior is uniform, MAP reduces to maximum likelihood estimation. In ML, we search for the image that makes the measured data most probable.\n\nThe process is iterative: we try candidate images, compute the probability that they would have produced the measured data, and adjust until we find one with the highest probability. That image is then reported as our reconstruction. In summary, if the prior distribution is non-informative, MAP and ML give the same result. Otherwise, MAP incorporates prior knowledge to guide the estimation.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

To explain this more simply, let us recall the idea of CT reconstruction. Imagine you have multiple views of an object. One view looks like this, another view looks different. Now, you try to reconstruct the underlying image. Suppose the underlying image is a star. When you trace the star vertically, the profile does not look right. When you trace it horizontally, again, it does not match. Then, you try using a different model—say, an ellipse. If you trace the ellipse horizontally, you obtain a profile that matches the measured data more closely. This suggests that the elliptical model fits best. In this case, you would report the ellipse as the reconstructed image.\n\nThis is essentially what maximum likelihood estimation does: you keep trying different underlying images, generate simulated measurements, and compare them to the actual data. When the simulated measurements maximize the probability of matching the real ones, that candidate is taken as the true image. This approach is fundamentally different from deterministic CT reconstruction methods. Instead of assuming the data is exact, it operates within a statistical framework.\nIn this framework, measurements are modeled with a Poisson distribution. Because of the independence of measurements, the overall likelihood can be expressed as a product of individual probabilities. By taking the natural logarithm, this product is converted into a summation, making the formulation simpler and more practical to compute. The key point is that the statistical model accounts for the Poisson noise inherent in the data, which deterministic methods ignore.\n\nTo see the advantage, consider a phantom experiment. If you introduce radioactive tracers into the phantom and reconstruct with filtered back projection, you are assuming no noise—that every measurement is an exact line integral. But in reality, measurements always have statistical fluctuations. This mismatch leads to streaking artifacts and random noise in the reconstructed images. By contrast, maximum likelihood reconstruction explains the fluctuations more accurately within the statistical model. As a result, the reconstructed images show fewer artifacts and improved quality, as demonstrated in the phantom example.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Overall, the images produced by filtered back projection are noisy and contain strong artifacts that reduce clarity and diagnostic value.\n\nIn contrast, maximum likelihood iterative reconstruction directly incorporates statistical knowledge into the reconstruction process. This approach produces images that are both visually and quantitatively improved. Noise is greatly reduced, artifacts are minimized, and the resulting images are more accurate and reliable for clinical use.\nThe side-by-side comparison highlights the advantage of maximum likelihood iterative reconstruction over traditional filtered back projection.

First, the CT image provides structural and anatomical information at a high spatial resolution. It shows the fine details and allows us to see different tissues clearly. On the PET image, you see the distribution of the radiotracer, and in this case, there is a lot of accumulation in one organ. This means the vasculature there is rich, actively taking in nutrients and glucose, which is a sign of rapid tumor growth. The radiotracer—often a form of glucose—is picked up as the tumor cells consume more nutrients than normal tissues. All these radiotracer molecules gather in regions of heightened metabolism, typically where tumors are present.\n\nWhen you superimpose the PET image over the CT image, you get excellent anatomical context. CT provides what's called the linear attenuation coefficient, and this is used to correct for tissue attenuation in PET. If you use only a uniform attenuation correction, the lungs—which actually have very low tissue density—can be misrepresented. Uniform correction assumes the same background for all regions, so in the lung, this leads to overestimation. In reality, the lungs attenuate the PET signal much less. If you apply uniform correction, you falsely report higher activity in the lungs than is accurate, simply because the tissue is less dense.\nCT solves this by providing individualized, tomographic detail for each region. The CT number for the lung is low, and when mapped to attenuation at 511 keV—the PET photon energy—you get a precise, much lower correction for lung tissue. This ensures the activity measurements from PET-CT are more accurate.\n\nLooking at the slide, you see areas where the tumor is intensely bright due to high tracer uptake—these signals are not good news because they reflect significant tumor activity. But after treatment, a follow-up PET-CT scan can show decreased brightness, meaning reduced metabolic activity and, therefore, an effective response to treatment.\nFinally, while CT is very good for showing anatomical detail, such as bone and tissue interfaces, it is not sensitive to soft tissue contrast. CT excels at showing dense structures, like bone, but metabolic changes and soft tissue differences are much better visualized by PET. The combination of PET and CT gives you both anatomical layout and functional information, making it a powerful tool in medical imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast, which is clear here—structures within the organs are visible in great detail. However, MRI is not ideal for imaging bone structures, and some areas, like those in the lungs, can be less distinct compared to CT. We'll be diving deeper into MRI starting from the next lecture, and I’ve already prepared a recorded session because there may be time constraints. I encourage you all to preview the MRI material; it’s a different modality altogether. MRI takes longer to acquire data, and its spatial resolution depends on the specific imaging agent and scan parameters, especially for maximum coverage of larger anatomical areas.\n\nBy combining PET with MRI—as shown here—you get unique diagnostic information. PET provides molecular and metabolic data, while MRI supplies detailed anatomical views, especially for the brain and soft tissue tumors. This fusion enables more precise diagnosis and assessment of diseases like cancer and neurological disorders. For brain imaging and soft tissue tumors, PET-MRI truly offers cutting-edge capability, making it a highly valuable technology in modern medical imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

This setup can be used for both human studies and small-animal imaging. Small animals are especially important in pharmaceutical research, since drug companies rely on them to test potential new drugs. The development of a drug typically passes through several phases: starting with cell cultures, then moving to small-animal studies, followed by preclinical trials, clinical trials, and eventually, market approval. Out of hundreds of drug candidates tested, only a very small fraction ever reach the market. This long, costly process is one reason why drug development is so expensive.\n\nThe pilot imaging ring itself consists of gamma detectors and the associated electronic circuitry. These detectors not only capture signals but also record timing information. When multiple gamma photons are detected within the same time window, the system identifies them as coming from the same event and reports a coincidence along a line of response. In this way, the line of response corresponds to the radio-tracer distribution along that line, which is essentially a line integral. The attenuation coefficient in this formulation is treated as independent and can be factored out.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

If you look at the components in detail, multiple figures highlight the power and structure of each unit. You start with a scintillation crystal at the front of each module. The scintillation crystal's job is to convert incoming gamma photons into visible light. This visible light is then captured by a photomultiplier tube, or PMT. The crystal and PMT work together—when the scintillation crystal creates visible light, the photomultiplier tube multiplies and amplifies that light signal, converting it into an electrical current. After the signal passes through the tube, it goes on to electronic circuits that process the electrical impulse.\n\nDepending on the amplitude of that impulse, you can determine the energy of the interacting gamma photon. One unit like this—consisting of an array of crystals and a set of PMTs—is called a \"block.\" Several blocks combined form a \"bucket,\" which can include hundreds of crystals. Multiple buckets are arranged together to create the full detector ring, which collects all the imaging data at once. There are additional engineering details in how these elements are assembled and how the signals are managed, but at its core, this system is designed to efficiently detect and process gamma events for reliable image reconstruction.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

I'll go through these quickly. First, the crystal should have a high density, which gives it a large effective cross-section for interacting with gamma rays. Next, you want a large effective atomic number—this increases gamma-ray detection efficiency by boosting photoelectric absorption. The decay time should be short; you need the crystal to release its light energy very quickly. If the decay time is too long, then each photon event can overlap in time, causing loss in timing resolution and poor image quality.\n\nA high light yield is also important—the crystal must convert as much gamma energy as possible into visible light, maximizing signal for efficient detection. Ideally, the wavelength of the emitted light should be near 400 nanometers, since photomultiplier tubes are most sensitive in this range, making the system more efficient. Additionally, the refractive index should be close to 1.5 to ensure optimal optical coupling between the crystal and the photomultiplier tube.\nThe crystal must also be non-hygroscopic, meaning it should not absorb moisture from the air. If it does, it can degrade and turn into powder, which would make it unusable for detector fabrication. All these properties are critical for reliable, high-performance medical imaging with PET scanners.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The key components for PET detectors start with the scintillation crystals, which are organized into blocks. Each block is coupled with multiple photomultiplier tubes in the background—typically four per block. These blocks are then assembled into a complete detector ring that surrounds the patient. As the PET system operates, the crystals detect incoming gamma photons, and the photomultiplier tubes convert the light produced by these interactions into electrical signals.\n\nThe system’s processing unit precisely monitors the electrical signals to determine exactly when and where events have occurred, and at what energy. The main gamma photon from a PET scan carries 511 keV energy. But if there is multiple scattering, such as Compton scattering inside the body, energy is lost and can complicate the signal. The electronics and coincidence processing unit integrate all detected events, and finally, this data is sent to the computer system.\nAfter data acquisition, image reconstruction begins—often with methods such as filtered back projection—to produce cross-sectional images.

This slide is a nice summary. A true event means you have a single annihilation, then two photons are emitted and detected by opposite detectors, and captured by the circuit. That's what you really want—these true coincidences are the signals that contribute to accurate image reconstruction.\n\nScatter events have different mechanisms. Here’s an example: a photon is emitted from an event, but gets scattered away before it reaches the detector. The system may report a coincidence along this scattered path, but it’s not the true line of response. This isn’t the real signal we need, so the scattered photon event should be removed—just like in CT, where scattering also occurs.\n\nRandom events are different. In this case, two gamma photons are generated from different events in the body, and one photon is detected in the same time window as another photon from a separate event. The system reports a coincidence, but along a line that doesn’t correspond to either true event—this is not accurate, and should be avoided if possible.\n\nIn 3D PET imaging, you can see that scattered and random events become more frequent, mainly because sensitivity increases due to the wider aperture and more possibilities for 3D data acquisition. So, it’s important to maximize sensitivity while minimizing scatter and random events to maintain image quality.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

This is actually simple. You set the energy window around the main photopeak. That's the main window right at the peak, and you collect counts there. Then, you also set windows on the left and right—these are the low and high-energy side windows. The idea is that you know the primary gamma photon should be at 511 keV, so its energy falls in the main window.\n\nIf there are scattered photons, their energy will be lower than 511 keV, so you’ll see them in the lower energy window. If there are random events or noise, these could appear in the higher energy window. By collecting data in both the lower and higher side windows, you have a way to estimate the background scattering.\nYou then assign weights to the counts in the lower and higher windows—this weighted combination gives you an estimate of the scattered background in the main window. With that estimate, you subtract the scattered contribution from the main window, giving you the corrected signal. This process lets you measure and remove the scatter components, so your final image is much cleaner and more accurate.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

If you have random events being recorded, they introduce noise into your data. For usual data processing, these random events really complicate things. But we can address this purposely: for each part of the detector, we introduce a delay.\n\nIf it’s a random coincidence, then the probability of the random event with this result delay is the same as without the delay. This is the key statement—this is the important idea. By introducing a delay in the coincidence detection, the probability line for incident and delayed results is the same, because the random coincidences depend on the average gamma-ray activity, which is assumed to be more or less constant over time. The delay itself doesn't change that rate.\n\nYou can then use the measured random events from the delayed window to directly estimate and subtract out the random event contribution from your true data. This approach gives you higher-quality, more quantitative results. That’s the whole idea behind random correction", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Ideally, you want to detect coincidences—by definition, in a given time window, you should only have two gamma-ray photons captured. If your time window is short enough, you get a well-controlled count rate, typically up to 100,000 per second, which is the principle behind coincidence detection. However, sometimes within a short time interval, you might have three gamma-ray photons reported simultaneously. How does this happen? For example, the first annihilation event is detected near detector two, so its gamma photon reaches that detector and is recorded. \n\nWithin that same time window, another event occurs closer to detector thirteen, and its sister photon travels a longer path. Before the photon from the second event reaches detector five, the third photon from the first event might reach detector ten. So, within the same interval, three photons can be detected as coincidences.\nWhenever you get triple coincidences—three detected photons in the same resolving window—they introduce confusion, and you simply discard that data. The system is designed to expect only pairs of coincident photons. If you see this higher-order event, you just throw it away, focusing only on true doubles.\n\nBut confusing situations remain: it’s hard to know which events should be assigned to which lines of response. That's where the correction factor formula comes in. For every true coincidence measurement, you also need to account for the data lost due to triple or higher-order coincidences. The formula shown here calculates the correction factor—combining both the estimated loss from discarded high-order events and the true measurement—to help restore your measured data to the real level. Sometimes, higher-order events may be very rare, but if your time window is wide enough, you might encounter even more photons simultaneously, which complicates things further. In practice, these cases are always discarded, and the formula allows you to estimate the amount of lost data. You then use this correction factor to scale your results back to the true count, improving accuracy in quantitative PET measurements.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

There are many correction methods, but the most important thing to understand from this lecture is to have a rough idea of how these corrections work.\n\nAll these corrections—including attenuation correction, scatter correction, random correction, and corrections for dead time—are essential to refine the measured signal and make sure your results reflect the true activity as accurately as possible.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The key point is that the data models are different, and the underlying technology relies on gamma rays, but at very different energies. SPECT uses lower-energy gamma rays, typically around 140 keV. Because of this lower energy, you can use a mechanical collimator—high-density metals effectively block unwanted photons, shaping the beam. But in PET, the gamma ray energy is much higher, at 511 keV. Mechanical collimation simply doesn’t work because the energy is too great for physical collimators, so PET uses electronic collimation instead.\n\nWith mechanical collimation, a large portion of useful gamma-ray photons is rejected, reducing sensitivity. By contrast, electronic collimation in PET does not block any useful gamma photons. This means PET sensitivity is fundamentally higher than SPECT sensitivity.\n\nAnother key feature is time information. In PET, two photons resulting from an annihilation are emitted simultaneously. The system records the precise timing, making time-resolved imaging possible and increasing sensitivity. In SPECT, we don’t know precisely when the radiotracer emits its gamma photons inside the body, so there’s no available time scale—just as in standard X-ray imaging, where we can’t control the emission timing for each photon. Even if you try to time the arrival of X-ray photons at a detector, you don’t have a proper time reference. With PET, the emission process gives you this timing, allowing sensitive and advanced time-resolved imaging. This is a crucial, elegant concept behind PET technology.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Although the reconstructions from those seven views weren’t fully impressive with the technology available back then, the idea remains promising.

You are welcome to do more if you wish.\n\nThe first problem is about isosensitive imaging, which I briefly introduced earlier. It involves taking two views and compensating in a specific way. The key idea is that if you assume a simple binary case with only one source distribution, you can multiply the views to achieve compensation. However, remember that this is not a universal solution—it applies only under limited assumptions.\n\nThe second question asks how many total counts are necessary to achieve 1 percent uniformity in a SPECT image, given a 128 by 128 data matrix. This problem is fairly straightforward. You can solve it using the Poisson distribution along with basic sensitivity concepts. The answer should follow directly from these principles.\nThe third exercise focuses on reducing statistical noise in an image. Consider what happens if you double the total imaging time, and separately, what happens if you double the mass of tracer injected. In each case, determine by what factor the noise in the image would be reduced.\nThe fourth problem asks you to compute the energy of gamma photons produced from positron emission. The correct result should be 511 keV. To calculate this, apply the formula E equal m c square If needed, look up the rest mass of the electron and positron.\n\nFinally, the fifth question addresses artificially high levels of radioactivity observed in PET lung images. You are asked to suggest one possible mechanism by which this effect could occur.

Up to this point, we have studied CT and nuclear imaging. These are already used together in hybrid imaging. CT provides us with detailed structural and anatomical information, while nuclear imaging methods, such as PET and SPECT, provide functional information by tracking radioactive tracers that participate in biochemical reactions within the body.\n\nBecause these two types of information are highly complementary, combining them makes the results much more powerful. That is why PET/CT scanners have become standard in many hospitals, especially in radiation oncology. More recently, companies like Siemens and GE have developed PET/MRI systems. However, CT and MRI have not yet been commercially combined, although research is moving in that direction.\n\nThe long-term vision is to bring CT, MRI, and nuclear imaging together into one unified system, giving us structural, functional, and biochemical information at the same time. This is the major trend in imaging—moving from individual modalities to hybrid and, eventually, fully integrated scanners.\nNow, with that context, let us move to our next imaging modality, MRI, which is unique in that it can provide both anatomical and functional information in a single technique.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

MRI is unique because it can provide two types of information. On one hand, it gives us anatomical information, very much like CT, by showing the structure of soft tissues. On the other hand, it can measure blood oxygenation levels, which adds functional information. That combination is what makes MRI so powerful.\nThe story begins in 1946, when Bloch at Stanford and Purcell at Harvard discovered nuclear magnetic resonance. For this work, they received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952. At that time, NMR was mainly used to measure signals from a whole sample.\nThen in 1973, Lauterbur at Stony Brook University introduced the idea of magnetic resonance imaging. The key innovation was to use gradient magnetic fields, which made it possible to turn NMR from a bulk measurement into a tomographic imaging technique. Now we could form images with pixels and voxels instead of just an overall signal. This breakthrough eventually earned Lauterbur and colleagues the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2003.\nBy the late 1970s, the first human MRI images were produced. In the early 1980s, commercial MRI systems became available. Then, in 1993, functional MRI was developed, allowing us to look at brain activity through blood oxygenation changes.\nAnd now, we are in the era of large-scale brain initiatives, where MRI continues to be at the center of neuroscience and clinical imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

At the center of the system, we have a large superconducting magnet. This magnet creates a very strong, stable magnetic field. Around it, we place gradient coils, which allow us to vary the magnetic field in different directions and make tomographic, or slice-by-slice, imaging possible.\n\nIn addition, we use radiofrequency coils, or RF coils. These coils send radio waves to disturb the alignment of the protons in the body. When the protons are tipped away from alignment, they begin to precess, and in doing so, they emit their own radiofrequency signals. The RF coils then detect these signals.\n\nWith the help of signal processing and mathematical reconstruction, we turn these detected signals into detailed images. Right now, it may sound abstract, but as we go deeper into the lecture, we will carefully unfold each of these components. For now, just keep in mind the big picture: a strong magnet, gradient coils for spatial encoding, RF coils for excitation and detection, and signal reconstruction to form the final images.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}
{"lecture": "Lecture 18", "slide_number": 7, "slide_filename": "Slide7.txt", "slide_annotation": "Lecture 18 - Slide7.txt", "file_path": "Lecture 18\\Texts\\Slide7.txt", "content": "To get a rough idea of how MRI works, let’s look at it step by step. \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging—MRI for short—can be modeled in the following way. First, consider this conducting loop of wire. The magnetic dipole moment is defined as the current going through the wire, times the cross-sectional area enclosed by the wire, times a unit vector perpendicular to that surface area. So the magnetic dipole moment points in the perpendicular direction, like this.\n\nNow, a proton is believed to spin on its axis at the subatomic level. Because it’s spinning, the magnetic dipole moment can be thought of as the sum of many tiny circulating currents. Whenever you take a dipole moment and place it in an external magnetic field, the dipole experiences a torque. That torque is given by the equation: tau equals mu cross B. In words: the torque equals the magnetic dipole moment crossed with the magnetic field.\nWhat this means is that the dipole moment will tend to align with the magnetic field. Imagine here is the B-field, and here is the dipole moment. When you take the cross product, you get a torque out of the board. That torque causes the dipole to rotate in this direction. The dipole will try to line up with the external B-field, but it won’t line up completely. The angular momentum of the spinning top—so to speak—prevents complete alignment. Instead, it undergoes precession, just like a spinning top wobbling around a vertical axis.\nSo, think of the proton as a spinning top. It rotates on its axis, but also precesses about an axis that is parallel to the external magnetic field.\nNow, let’s introduce radiation. We emit an electromagnetic wave laterally, toward the precession axis. For simplicity, I’ve drawn only the magnetic component, oscillating in and out of the board as it travels laterally. If the angular frequency of this radiation equals the angular frequency of precession, resonance occurs.\n\nWe define the Larmor angular frequency:\u000bomega L equals gamma times B-naught.\nHere gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. For a proton, gamma is about two-point-sixty-seven times ten to the eighth radians per second per tesla. To convert from radians per second to hertz, we divide by two-pi. So,\ntwo-pi f L equals gamma times B-naught.\nOr equivalently:\u000bf L equals gamma over two-pi, times B-naught.\nNumerically, this works out to about forty-two megahertz per tesla.\nSo, the frequency of the applied radiation matches the precession frequency of the proton. Whenever the proton comes around to a certain point, the applied B-field is right there to interact with it. The torque tends to flatten the precession, step by step, as the proton keeps rotating.\nWhen the radiation is turned off, the proton flips back to its original motion, precessing around the external magnetic field axis. This is the fundamental mechanism of magnetic resonance. Historically, it was called nuclear magnetic resonance, but later changed to simply magnetic resonance—mostly for public perception, since “nuclear” tends to worry people.\n\nNow let’s take a group of hydrogen atoms. The body contains a large amount of hydrogen, because we are mostly water—H2O. Initially, the dipole moments of hydrogen protons are randomly oriented. When we apply an external magnetic field, the protons tend to align with the field, precessing around its axis.\nWhen we emit radiation laterally, as we discussed before, the protons flatten out. Then, when the radiation is turned off, the protons flip back. Think of this like a spring being released. As they flip back, they emit radiation. That emitted radiation can be detected and processed to form an image.\nIn 1973, a breakthrough came from Paul Lauterbur—he showed that you could actually use this principle to create images. The idea was: take a subject, place them inside a tube with a strong superconducting magnet, on the order of five tesla. The magnetic field is aligned along the axis of the tube, so all the protons line up and precess.\n\nThen, apply a secondary magnetic field that produces a gradient along the axis of the tube. That means the magnetic field is slightly stronger at one end, weaker at the other. Because the Larmor frequency depends on the field strength, different positions along the tube correspond to different precession frequencies.\nFor example, at a position one-point-three meters down the tube, the magnetic field might be B1, slightly larger than B0. Substituting B1 into the equation, you find a different resonance frequency. By tuning the applied radiation frequency, only protons at that slice will resonate and emit radiation. This gives spatial localization.\nEngineers extended this idea. By using different gradient coils—like the saddle coil shown here—they can create gradients not only along the Z-axis, but also in the X and Y directions. That way, we can localize signals to small cubes of tissue, called voxels, inside the body.\n\nFinally, only tissues containing hydrogen—meaning water and fat—produce signal. That’s why MRI works so well for imaging soft tissues in the human body.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Areas in the body that contain a lot of water, like soft tissues, produce strong signals, which show up bright in the image. Areas with little water, like bone, produce weak signals, so they appear dark. That is the basic contrast mechanism in MRI.\nThe short lecture we just saw is an excellent example of how to present these key principles clearly. I encourage you to revisit it after you study the details, because once you learn the full physics of MRI, you will be able to understand nearly all of it.\n\nNow, let’s review some of the mathematical foundations. One important concept is the dot product. If we have two vectors, v and w, their dot product is equal to the magnitude of v times the magnitude of w times the cosine of the angle between them. Geometrically, the dot product measures how much one vector projects onto another. You can think of it as relating to the area formed by the parallelogram between the two vectors.\n\nThis is a very elegant mathematical operation, and it also has a counterpart called the cross product, which we will look at next.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

When you take two vectors, say vector a and vector b, their cross product is not a scalar like the dot product, but instead a new vector. The magnitude of this vector is equal to the length of a times the length of b times the sine of the angle between them. The direction of the result is perpendicular to the plane formed by a and b, determined by the right-hand rule.\n\nSo while the dot product gives us a projection, the cross product gives us an orthogonal vector that carries both magnitude and direction. This operation is not just a mathematical trick—it has deep physical meaning. In MRI physics, cross products appear naturally when we describe torques, angular momentum, and precession, making them essential to understanding the behavior of magnetic moments in an external field.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Linear momentum is straightforward: it is mass times velocity. According to Newton’s second law, the time derivative of linear momentum is force. That means if you want to change momentum, you need to apply a force, which changes velocity.\nNow, when we move from linear motion to rotational motion, we deal with angular momentum. Angular momentum is defined as the cross product of the position vector r and the linear momentum p. So, L equals r cross p.\n\nTo change angular momentum, we need torque. Torque is also defined through a cross product: r cross F, the position vector crossed with the applied force. Just as force is the reason linear momentum changes, torque is the reason angular momentum changes.\nThis is really just an extension of Newton’s second law into rotational dynamics. The derivative of angular momentum with respect to time equals torque. In other words, torque is the rotational analog of force.\n\nThis connection shows why the cross product is essential. It is not only a mathematical operation but also the key to describing how forces lead to changes in rotation. This principle is central in understanding precession and magnetization, which we will soon connect back to MRI physics.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The force is proportional to the product of the two charges, divided by the square of the distance between them. So the closer the charges, the stronger the force.\nThis simple idea about electric forces will be important when we connect electricity and magnetism, and eventually link these basic interactions to the physics of MRI.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Clinical MRI systems typically operate at one and a half Tesla, three Tesla, or even higher in research settings. These strong fields are essential for aligning enough protons in the body to generate measurable signals.\nSo while the Earth’s magnetic field is important for navigation and protecting us from solar radiation, it is far too weak for imaging.

By sending current through a coil, we can generate powerful magnetic fields, and the more loops of wire we use, the stronger the field becomes.\n\nThis connection between electricity and magnetism is fundamental to MRI.

If nothing changes in the magnetic field passing through the loop, no current flows. But if you insert a magnet into the loop, or pull it out, the magnetic field inside the loop changes. This change induces a current in the loop.\n\nThis is Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. The induced current always acts to oppose the change that caused it, a principle known as Lenz’s law. So if you try to increase the magnetic field, the induced current will create a field that resists that increase. If you decrease the magnetic field, the induced current will create a field that resists the decrease.\nThis interplay between electricity and magnetism is fundamental for MRI.

They unite everything we have talked about: charges producing electric fields, magnetic fields produced by currents, and the deep connection between electricity and magnetism.\nIn these equations, the dot product is used to describe divergence—how field lines flow in or out of a point. The cross product is used to describe curl—how field lines twist or circulate.

Magnetization describes how many of these tiny moments add up into a collective vector that we can measure in bulk.

Protons carry positive charges, while neutrons are electrically neutral. Since all the protons are positively charged, they would naturally repel each other. But they are held together by the strong nuclear force, which balances out the electromagnetic repulsion and creates a stable nucleus.\n\nThis balance of forces is what allows atoms to exist in a stable form.

You can picture it as a miniature bar magnet, with a north pole and a south pole.\nIf we take just one proton—say, from a hydrogen atom in a water molecule—it acts like a tiny magnet. But in the body, we have countless protons, and in the absence of an external magnetic field, their magnetic moments point in random directions. As a result, they cancel out, and there is no overall magnetic effect.\nHowever, when we apply a strong external magnetic field, something very interesting happens.

Just as torque can change the angular momentum of a top, external influences can change the angular momentum of a proton.\nBut unlike a simple spinning top, the proton also carries an electric charge. Because of this, it has not only mechanical properties but also electromagnetic ones. Its magnetic behavior is summarized by the magnetic moment miu.\n\nThe beautiful part is that these two quantities—angular momentum and magnetic moment—are directly linked. The relationship is miu equals gamma times P, where gamma is a constant called the gyromagnetic ratio.\nQuantum mechanics adds one more layer: angular momentum cannot take on any arbitrary value but is quantized. It is expressed in terms of the spin quantum number, I. For a proton, I equals one-half, so the angular momentum follows a specific formula.\n\nThe main takeaway is this: the proton’s mechanical rotation and its electromagnetic behavior are tied together in a very simple and elegant way.

Classically, you might imagine that the magnetic moment could point in any direction. But quantum mechanics tells us that only certain orientations are allowed.\n\nSpecifically, we focus on the longitudinal component of the magnetic moment, meaning the part aligned with the external field. For the proton, this component can take on only two values: one parallel to the field and one antiparallel. These values are determined by the nuclear magnetic quantum number, m I, which for a proton can be plus one-half or minus one-half.\n\nSo, the z-component of the magnetic moment, miu z, equals plus or minus gamma times Planck’s constant divided by four pi. This means the magnetic moment is never perfectly aligned—it is always tilted slightly.

In the parallel case, the magnetic moment lines up with the field, and this state has lower energy. In the antiparallel case, the magnetic moment points against the field, and this state has higher energy.\n\nSo, instead of a continuous range of orientations, quantum mechanics restricts protons to just these two discrete states. The energy difference between them is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.\nThis is similar to a mechanical analogy: imagine trying to rotate a bar magnet in a strong external field. If you align it with the field, that is the stable, low-energy position. If you force it to oppose the field, that requires work and corresponds to a higher-energy state.\n\nThis splitting of energy levels is fundamental in MRI. It is the small difference in populations between protons in the lower-energy parallel state and the higher-energy antiparallel state that generates the net magnetization we rely on to produce signals.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Instead, it undergoes a motion very much like a spinning top. The top leans and slowly wobbles around the vertical axis. In the same way, the magnetic moment traces out a precession around the magnetic field direction. We’ll go into more detail on this soon.\n\nTo explain why this happens, we need to go back to Newton’s second law—not just in the familiar form, force equals mass times acceleration, but in the rotational context. In rotations, the central quantity is angular momentum.\nThe law tells us that the time derivative of angular momentum, written as dL over dt, is equal to torque. So, torque is the rotational analog of force. Just as force changes linear momentum, torque changes angular momentum.\nThe derivation on this slide shows the details. If you’re interested in the full proof, you can follow it step by step. If not, you can simply trust the key result: the rate of change of angular momentum equals torque.\n\nThis is the foundation we need to understand precession in MRI physics.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The top’s axis of rotation points in one direction, representing the angular momentum. If no external force acts on it, the top will keep spinning steadily, just as a moving object keeps moving in a straight line.\n\nNow, if a force is applied — here, gravity acting at the center of mass — it produces a torque. Torque is given by the cross product of the lever arm vector r and the force vector F. In this case, r cross F points into the page. That means the torque is perpendicular to the angular momentum.\nWhen the torque is perpendicular, it doesn’t stop the motion or flip the top over directly. Instead, it causes a small change, delta L, that is also perpendicular to the original angular momentum. This sideways change makes the tip of the angular momentum vector trace out a circle.\nSo instead of falling over, the spinning top precesses—it wobbles around in a circular path.\n\nAnd that is the key insight: whenever a spinning object with angular momentum experiences a torque perpendicular to it, the result is precession. In MRI, the proton’s magnetic moment behaves just like this spinning top, precessing around the direction of the external magnetic field.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

You might wonder: why doesn’t it just fall straight down? The answer is that there is always a centripetal force pointing inward, toward the center of the orbit.\n\nThat centripetal force doesn’t change the magnitude of the velocity, but it does change its direction. Because the force is always perpendicular to the velocity vector, it continuously “bends” the path, keeping the satellite in circular motion rather than letting it fly off in a straight line.\nMathematically, the centripetal force is equal to mass times velocity squared, divided by the radius: F equals m v squared over r.\n\nNow connect this to angular momentum. When the change in a vector is always perpendicular to the vector itself, the result is circular motion. In the orbital case, the velocity vector keeps changing direction, while in angular momentum, the same principle applies: torque causes a perpendicular change in angular momentum, and so the angular momentum vector itself traces out a circle.\n\nThis is the key point to understand precession: a perpendicular change leads to circular motion.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The Larmor frequency depends on two things: the strength of the magnetic field and a constant called the gyromagnetic ratio, which is unique for each type of nucleus.\nMathematically, we write the Larmor frequency as omega zero equals gamma times B zero. Here, omega zero represents the precession frequency, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B zero is the strength of the magnetic field.\n\nThis relationship tells us that the stronger the field, the faster the precession.

This torque can be written as mu cross B zero. That torque is what drives the angular momentum to change over time.\nMathematically, we can say: torque equals the derivative of angular momentum with respect to time. In other words, dP by dt equals mu cross B zero.\n\nHere, P is the angular momentum. Because protons both have mass and positive charge, their spinning motion not only produces angular momentum but also generates a tiny current loop. That current loop is associated with a magnetic moment. And so, whenever the magnetic moment is not aligned with the magnetic field, it feels a torque.\nNow, to connect the pieces: magnetic moment and angular momentum are directly proportional. That means the change in angular momentum is tied to the change in magnetic moment.\nTo see how this becomes precision, consider a very small angular change, which we call d phi. For such small changes, the sine of d phi can be approximated as just d phi. With this, we can relate torque to the rate of change of the angular position.\nSo the angular frequency of precession, written as omega, is equal to the torque divided by the magnitude of angular momentum times sine theta. If you expand the cross product, you eventually find that omega equals gamma times B zero.\n\nHere, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, a constant specific to the nucleus.\nThis final result is extremely important: the precessional frequency is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. In a stronger field, the spins precess faster. In a weaker field, they precess more slowly. This proportionality is the foundation of magnetic resonance.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Instead, because of torque, it precesses around the point where it is supported. If I increase the downward force—for example, by adding the weight of a wrench to the axle—you can see that the precession frequency increases.\n\nThis is the same principle that applies in MRI. The frequency of precession is directly linked to the strength of the magnetic field. Stronger forces or fields lead to faster precession.

This imbalance, even though very small, is crucial.\n\nBecause the magnetic moments are vectors, those that are opposite to each other will cancel out in the transverse plane. What remains is a small excess of protons in the parallel state, and when we add up all of their contributions, we obtain a single net vector pointing along the direction of the magnetic field. This is what we call the net magnetization vector, often denoted as M.\nFrom this point on, instead of worrying about the behavior of individual protons, we can focus on this collective magnetization vector. We can treat it as a classical vector that can tilt, rotate, or precess, just like a spinning top.

This is the transition point — from theory into application. The key question becomes: once the protons are aligned and precessing in the magnetic field, how do we disturb them in a controlled way and measure the response?\nThat’s where the radiofrequency pulse comes in. By applying a carefully tuned RF pulse, we can perturb the magnetization vector and create a measurable signal. In the upcoming slides, I’ll explain this process step by step — beginning with RF perturbation, then the Bloch equations that describe the dynamics, and finally, how we detect the free induction decay signal.\n\nSo, let’s pay attention to the next slide — this is where MRI really comes alive.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

We have this net magnetization vector, which is called M-naught. It reflects the water and lipid content in the body, because that’s where most of the hydrogen protons are found. That sounds great, but the important question is: how do we actually measure M-naught?\nIf you just leave M-naught alone in its steady state, it aligns with the main magnetic field and stays constant in time. A static field like this will not generate any measurable electrical signal. Remember, electromagnetic induction only works when the magnetic field is changing. A constant magnetization produces nothing in our detection coil.\n\nThe key idea is this: if we can flip M-naught away from its alignment with the main field, then it will gain a transverse component. That transverse part does not just sit there — it precesses, meaning it rotates around the axis of the main magnetic field. This rotating transverse magnetization produces an alternating magnetic field. An alternating field is exactly what we need, because it induces an electrical signal in the detection coil.\n\nThis was the breakthrough that launched nuclear magnetic resonance. It was discovered in nineteen forty-six by Felix Bloch at Stanford and Edward Purcell at Harvard, and their work was recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physics in nineteen fifty-two.\nSo the essential trick is: flip the net magnetization, create a transverse component, let it precess, and detect the alternating signal that comes out.

No magnetic field is changing, so no signal can be detected. But once we flip it, we break that balance. Now there is a transverse component of magnetization. This transverse part does not stay still — it undergoes circular motion, what we call precession. And this precessing transverse component produces an alternating magnetic field, which can then be measured through electromagnetic induction, as described by Maxwell’s equations.\n\nSo how do we flip the magnetization to break the balance? To answer that, we look at the energy difference between the parallel state and the anti-parallel state of the protons. Earlier, we derived this difference and called it delta E.\nThis energy difference must be supplied by an incoming electromagnetic wave. And the energy carried by a photon is equal to Planck’s constant times the frequency. That means the frequency of the applied radiofrequency wave has to exactly match the energy gap between the two spin states.\nWhen you rearrange the formulas, you find that the resonant frequency, written as f, is equal to gamma times B-zero divided by two pi. In terms of angular frequency, written as omega, the result is omega equals gamma times B-zero.\n\nThis is a fundamental result. It tells us that the Larmor precession frequency of the proton is identical to the frequency of the radiofrequency field we must apply to drive transitions between the parallel and the anti-parallel states.\nSo, from the quantum mechanical point of view, resonance occurs when the radiofrequency wave carries exactly the right energy to match that gap — and that is the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

They naturally relax back down to the lower energy state, which is the more stable configuration. As they do so, the excess energy is released. Importantly, the released energy is in the form of the same radiofrequency signal that was used to excite them.\n\nThis emitted signal is what we detect externally.

The cross product between the magnetization vector and B-one produces a torque. This torque acts in the direction perpendicular to both vectors, and it causes the magnetization to tip away from the z-axis.\nBut remember, the system is still precessing around the main magnetic field. So the magnetization doesn’t simply tilt once and stop—it spirals away from the z-axis, tracing out a cone. The longer we apply the B-one field, the further the vector tips, increasing the flip angle.\n\nThis picture is very convenient to describe using the concept of a rotating frame.

Instead of staying in the laboratory coordinate system, we can shift into a rotating frame of reference. This is a coordinate system that rotates at exactly the Larmor frequency.\n\nIn this rotating frame, the spiral disappears.

That is resonance: applying a force at the right frequency so that every push adds up.\n\nIn MRI, the same idea holds. The RF signal has to be applied at the exact precessional frequency—the Larmor frequency. If it matches, then every cycle of the RF field keeps nudging the spins in the same direction. In the rotating frame, this no longer looks like an oscillating wave. Instead, it looks like a steady force, a constant torque, applied to the magnetization vector.\nThat constant torque is what tips the magnetization away from the z-axis.

In that case, you do not see any visible precession, even though the vector is still technically circling like a single dot.\n\nNext, think about what happens when we flip M. Suppose M is rotated away from the z-axis into the transverse plane. Now the magnetization has a horizontal component, which we call M x y. This component will oscillate and produce an alternating magnetic field. That is the field that induces a measurable signal in the nearby coil.\nPhysically, you can imagine the magnetization vector as a magnetic bar. If you keep flipping or rotating this bar, the field it produces also keeps changing. That changing field drives current in the coil, which is exactly what we detect as the MR signal. The amplitude of this signal depends on proton density: the more protons available, the stronger the signal.\n\nNow, after the excitation pulse ends, the system will gradually return to equilibrium. The z-component of magnetization, M z, will recover to its steady-state value M zero. This recovery is governed by the T1 relaxation process, sometimes called spin-lattice relaxation. At the same time, the transverse component M x y will decay toward zero. This loss of coherence is governed by T2 relaxation, also called spin-spin relaxation.\nSo, to summarize:\nT1 describes how the longitudinal magnetization M z returns to equilibrium.\nT2 describes how the transverse magnetization M x y decays to zero.\n\nBoth of these effects are essential in shaping the MR signal we actually record.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Even though they were flipped together, local differences in their environment cause them to fall out of step.\nT2-star relaxation is an additional effect that comes from imperfections in the magnetic field itself. The field is never perfectly uniform, and small local variations cause the spins to dephase even faster. This effect is especially important in functional MRI, where susceptibility differences are actually used to generate contrast.\nThe key point is that the MR signal we detect — the NMR signal — is proportional to proton density, but reduced by these T1, T2, and T2-star factors.\n\nAnd this is what gives MRI its powerful contrasts. For example:\nT1 weighting helps us distinguish gray matter from white matter.\nT2 weighting highlights tissues and fluid, such as cerebrospinal fluid.\nT2-star weighting is especially useful for functional MRI, because it is sensitive to magnetic susceptibility changes, such as those caused by blood oxygenation.\nSo, signal decay is not a nuisance. In fact, it’s what makes MRI such a versatile imaging tool.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Some of them precess a little faster, and others precess a little slower. As a result, they gradually drift out of phase with one another.\nWhen that happens, their contributions begin to cancel out. The net transverse magnetization shrinks, even though each proton is still spinning.\nOn the graph at the bottom, you can see this process clearly. The transverse magnetization starts at its maximum value and then decays exponentially toward zero as the moments become more and more dephased.\n\nThis is the essence of the T2 relaxation process: it measures how quickly the spins lose phase coherence in the transverse plane, leading to signal decay.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Mathematically, we say that M z of time equals M naught multiplied by one minus e to the power of negative t over T1. In plain words, this means the recovery depends on a time constant, T1, which tells us how quickly the spins realign with the main magnetic field.\n\nNext, for the transverse components, which are M x and M y, these decay over time. Their rate of decay is described by the time constant T2. The equations are written as d M x over d t equals minus M x divided by T2, and d M y over d t equals minus M y divided by T2. In other words, both x and y components shrink exponentially toward zero, at a rate determined by T2.\n\nSo, together, T1 and T2 give us a semi-quantitative model for MRI. T1 governs how fast the longitudinal magnetization recovers, and T2 governs how fast the transverse magnetization disappears.

The first is the so-called pure T2 decay, which comes from intrinsic spin–spin interactions inside the tissue. This is a physiological and biological effect, and it represents the fundamental limit of how long spins can stay in phase with one another.\n\nThe second contribution comes from spatial variations in the magnetic field strength inside the body. In practice, no magnet is perfectly uniform. There are always small imperfections in the main field, B zero. In addition, different tissues have slightly different magnetic susceptibilities, especially at boundaries between air and tissue, or bone and tissue. These local variations cause spins to accumulate extra phase shifts, further accelerating the loss of coherence. This additional contribution is represented by T2 prime.\nWhen we put these together, the overall transverse relaxation time we observe is called T2 star. Mathematically, the rate of decay of T2 star is the sum of the rates of T2 and T2 prime. That is, one over T2 star equals one over T2 plus one over T2 prime.\n\nSo in summary:\nT2 reflects fundamental spin–spin interactions.\nT2 prime reflects field inhomogeneity and susceptibility effects.\nT2 star combines both, and it is the effective decay time we actually measure in many MRI sequences.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

This rotates whatever longitudinal magnetization has recovered into the transverse plane. Once in the transverse plane, it generates a measurable free induction decay, or FID signal, that is subject to T2 star decay.\nBy repeating this process with different inversion times and recording the signals, we can map out the full recovery curve.

This flips all the spins over, so that the ones that were leading are now behind, and the ones that were lagging are now in front. As time continues, these spins re-converge, and at a later time, they come back into phase. When that happens, we see the spins add constructively and produce a strong signal, known as the spin echo.\nThe height of this echo decays with the true T2 relaxation time, not with T2 star. By repeating the sequence with different time delays, we can track how quickly the echo signal diminishes, and from that, extract the T2 constant.\n\nThis technique is both simple and powerful: it cancels out static inhomogeneities in the magnetic field and isolates the true spin-spin relaxation, which is exactly what T2 represents.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Even if you understood it the first time, it’s always good to refresh these key concepts.\n\nThe key point is to model and understand T1 and T2, which are critical relaxation parameters. Along with these, proton density is also an essential factor, and fortunately, that one is fairly easy to understand. Think of it this way: you have a collection of small magnets, whose density is proportional to proton density, and together they form a large magnetization vector, usually called the big M vector. Once you begin to manipulate this M vector, you immediately see the effects of T1 and T2.\n\nT1 and T2 are intrinsic properties of tissues. They vary with tissue type, and they are very important for functional and even molecular imaging. You need to understand how the MRI signal changes under the influence of T1 and T2, and how these quantities can be measured. When you do this properly, you can create multi-contrast MRI images, such as proton-density-weighted, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted images.\n\nThis is much more complicated than what we encounter in X-ray imaging. In X-ray, the main parameter is the linear attenuation coefficient. Even though this coefficient is energy-dependent, it still gives us a straightforward measure: it tells us how many photons, or what fraction of photons, will be attenuated when an X-ray beam passes through a given thickness of a given tissue type.\n\nBy contrast, T1 and T2 are not so simple. They require more imagination—especially geometrical imagination—to grasp.\nNow, the remaining two parts of today’s lecture—slice selection and sampling in k-space—are where MRI becomes truly powerful. These steps allow us to extract MRI signals from the sample, or from the patient, in a spatially specific way. That’s how we generate cross-sectional or even volumetric images of the human body.\n\nIn summary: today we will begin by revisiting T1 and T2 modeling and measurement, and then move on to slice selection and k-space sampling. These latter two are really the emphasis of this lecture. In the previous session, we talked about MRI imaging principles. Now we will extend that foundation and see how it translates into actual imaging techniques.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

T1 and T2 are quite different.\n\nT1: We talk about the recovery of the M vector along the z-axis — that’s the main field direction. T1 time is defined as sixty-three percent recovery of our original M vector, which we call M-naught. This is about spin–lattice interaction, something that involves energy.\nWhen you turn the M vector into a certain direction, like a ninety-degree direction, the energy you used — injected into the tissue — will eventually be lost due to spin–lattice interaction. And it will gradually return to the steady state. The M vector wants to be aligned along the main field direction, which is the B-naught field, or the z direction.\n\nOn the other hand, the T2 parameter talks about the dephasing effect. The M vector is not just an individual thing — it’s really a collective phenomenon. All of the small magnets, the spinning protons, are very small magnets. Altogether, they form the big M vector.\nIf you flip the M vector, say by ninety degrees, from the z direction into the y or x direction, this big M vector at first points all in one direction. But it is made of many small magnets, and some of those spins are faster, some are slower, because of inhomogeneity in the B-naught field or in the local field. The local field — ions, molecules, molecular motion — all these things contribute to that inhomogeneity.\n\nOriginally, all the small magnets line up along the x-axis. If you apply a ninety-degree pulse with respect to the y-axis, you flip the M vector along the x-axis. But with time, this will dephase. Some processes are a little faster, some slower. And after a long enough time, all these small magnets, or spinning protons, are pointing in different directions.\n\nThe overall field is no longer this original M-naught. Instead, it becomes effectively zero. The decay is modeled as an exponential curve — something like what you see on the slide. So, this is recovery, and this is decay. That is the T1, T2 story.\nLet me give you a little more mathematical detail so you understand why both the recovery and the dephasing follow an exponential curve. One is growing, the other is decaying. It’s something like this.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

You keep seeing this kind of first-order differential equation in multiple imaging modalities. For example, in X-ray imaging, you have the initial beam intensity. It will be attenuated. The amount of attenuation — the change of the X-ray flux — is proportional to the initial flux, which we call I-naught.\n\nSimilarly, here in MRI, with y, we are talking about the initial M vector, which is M-naught.

That gives:\u000by equals A e to the k t, where A is a constant.\n\nThis shows that whenever the process is described by a first-order differential equation, the solution must be of this form: y is exponential growth or exponential decay.

T2 has two components, and it describes dephasing. The first dephasing is what we call the pure T2 effect, or spin–spin interaction. This happens because all the spinning protons are close to each other, and you do not have an absolutely uniform distribution. If you look microscopically, the spins interact with one another, and there are fluctuations in the local magnetic field. These effects are called pure T2, shown here in red, and they are due to spin–spin interaction. This behavior in soft tissue is physiological, and it cannot really be changed — it is a natural biological phenomenon.\n\nOn the other hand, when you place a patient, or even a small animal, in an external magnetic field — the B-naught field — we usually describe that field as uniform. But in reality, the B-naught field is never perfectly homogeneous. There will always be some inhomogeneity. This inhomogeneity is fixed: when you set up the B-naught field, some regions are slightly weaker, while other regions are slightly stronger. So, in one location, the spins process a little slower, and in another location, they process a little faster. That difference also contributes to dephasing.\n\nSo, both biological spin–spin interaction inside the tissue, and physical inhomogeneity of the external magnetic field, contribute to the same dephasing effect, but for different reasons. The external contribution is fixed and constant, while the biological part cannot really be corrected.\nWhen we combine these two, we call the result T2 star. The external field inhomogeneity alone is called T2 plus. So, in summary: T2 star is the combined effect of external field inhomogeneity and biological spin–spin interaction. And importantly, there is a reciprocal relationship between them.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

We start with a constant, K. This K describes the strength of dephasing. If dephasing is due to spin–spin interaction, we can call it K1. If dephasing is due to external magnetic field inhomogeneity, we can call it K2. So, the total rate of dephasing is due to both K1 plus K2. Then, the time constant is simply the reciprocal of that total: one over K1 plus K2. That’s where the reciprocal relationship comes in.\n\nIf you still feel unclear, let’s connect it to something we already studied: nuclear imaging. When we studied nuclear decay, we said that a radioactive tracer inside the body disappears through two processes. One is physical radioactive decay, which happens naturally over time. The other is biological clearance, where the tracer leaves the body through circulation, mainly through urination. So, there are two mechanisms removing the tracer — one biological and the other physical — and together, they follow the same reciprocal rule.\n\nIn that case, we use the decay constant, lambda. The overall decay rate is lambda-one plus lambda-two, and the corresponding half-life is the reciprocal of lambda. So, just like in nuclear decay, where both physical and biological processes add together, in MRI, both spin–spin interaction and external inhomogeneity add together. Don’t be confused if you see these different equations — equation two-point-four for nuclear medicine and equation four-point-two-nine for MRI — because mathematically, they are describing the same idea.\n\nTo summarize: when we talk about T2, we really mean three different things. One is the biological T2, or pure spin–spin relaxation. The second is T2 plus, from external field inhomogeneity. And the third is T2 star, the combined effect of both. Now we have T1 and T2.

Without a transverse component, if you place a coil close to the patient, there is no signal to measure.\n\nNow, after a time delay, tau, we apply a ninety-degree pulse. This rotates some of the magnetization into the transverse plane. And once that happens, the coil can detect a signal. This is the signal you see here. Notice that the signal itself also decays. Why? Because of dephasing. And ask yourself — is this dephasing due to T2, or due to T2 star? The answer is T2 star, because it includes both spin–spin interaction and the effect of field inhomogeneity.\n\nSo, this is the inversion recovery method: a one-eighty-degree pulse, followed by a time delay, and then a ninety-degree pulse that produces a measurable signal.

And this is illustrated here.\n\nLet’s review carefully. First, you apply a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse, and the magnetization vector M-naught becomes minus M-naught. If you don’t do anything, this remains negative. Originally, you had a positive M-naught, but after the one-eighty pulse, it became negative M-naught. This negative magnetization will gradually recover back toward the original M-naught, returning to the normal, stable equilibrium. If you wait long enough, this negative value will rise, reach zero, and then continue climbing until it becomes fully positive again.\n\nSo it all depends on tau — the delay. At first, the amplitude is negative, then it grows smaller in magnitude, reaches zero, and then becomes positive, growing larger and larger toward M-naught. Now, if at some point during this recovery you apply a ninety-degree pulse, flipping it into the transverse plane — along the y-axis — you create a transverse component, and that can be measured. At this moment, you will have a signal.\n\nBut this signal is subject to T2 star decay, so what you measure is a free induction decay, or F-I-D signal. By repeating this process with different delay times, different values of tau, you can measure the signal amplitude as a function of tau-n. Then, you can plot this relationship. By arranging the equation properly, you get an exponential form with an index of minus tau-n divided by T1. If you take the logarithm, you can obtain a straight line. The slope of that line is minus one over T1, and from this slope, you can determine the T1 relaxation time.\n\nNow, be careful: if you directly take the log, you will not immediately get T1. You need to rearrange the equation. But one important point is that M-naught is known, because you can measure it directly. That’s why this works.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

But what we want is the pure T2, which reflects tissue physiology and pathology.\n\nPure T2 is a biological effect, while T2 star is dominated by external field imperfections. Since your patient’s physiological status should not depend on imperfections in the external field, we really want to measure T2.\n\nSo how do we do it? Spin echo. First, you let the spins dephase for a short time. Then you apply a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse. What happens? Some spins are lagging — they have a phase delay. Other spins are moving faster — they have an advanced phase. After the one-eighty-degree flip, the lagging spins continue to lag, and the faster spins continue to advance. But because their positions have been reversed by the flip, they will eventually meet again and refocus at a certain point.\n\nAt that refocusing point, the signal strength grows again, giving you the spin echo.

This instantly flips the distribution. The red, slower spins are moved to the position where the black, faster spins were, and the black spins take the place of the red ones. But remember, the red spins are inherently slower. So even though they were moved ahead, they continue to process slowly. The black spins are inherently faster, so even though they were moved behind, they continue to process quickly.\n\nNow, after the same amount of time passes, both groups realign again. The faster black spins catch up, and the slower red spins fall into place. At that moment, all the spins point together again, aligned in the same direction.\n\nBecause they are all aligned, their contributions add up constructively, and the transverse magnetization reaches its maximum. This produces a measurable signal in the nearby coils — the spin echo signal.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Imagine you have a group of students lining up at a race track. At the starting point, they are all together, right at the start line. After the signal, they all run toward the finish line. Some students are faster, and some are slower. So after a certain time, they will have covered different distances.\n\nNow, at that moment, we ask them all to turn around and keep running, but in the opposite direction. The faster runners, who had gone farther ahead, now have a longer distance to come back. The slower runners, who didn’t go as far, have a shorter distance to cover. But because they are slower, their speed matches the distance they need to make up.\n\nAfter the same amount of time, both the fast and slow runners arrive back at the starting line together. They all realign again. This is the basic idea behind spin echo. By using this trick, we can measure T1, the pure T2, without the interference of the external field inhomogeneity.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

And from it, we get two very important parameters.\n\nThe first one is the echo time, which we write as T-E. This is defined as the time from the ninety-degree pulse to the echo peak. In practice, you apply a ninety-degree pulse, then a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse, and the time from the ninety-degree to the one-eighty is T-E divided by two. Then, after the one-eighty pulse, you wait another T-E divided by two, and that’s when the spin echo appears.\nThe spin echo amplitude reflects the decay due to pure T-two, independent of external field inhomogeneity. That’s the significance of T-E.\n\nThe second parameter is the repetition time, or T-R. After the first sequence, you can wait for a time T-R, and then repeat the same trick, ninety degrees, one-eighty degrees, another spin echo. But in order for the system to be in a stable state, T-R has to be long enough so that the magnetization vector M-naught has fully recovered.\n\nIf, for example, T-R is chosen as two thousand milliseconds, that may not be long enough for full recovery. In that case, the longitudinal magnetization is still less than the original M-naught, and the signal will be reduced.\nSo this is why T-E and T-R are significant. By definition, T-E should always be less than T-R.\n\nNow, this also connects to imaging. At the top, when we look at the spin echo for the whole sample, we get one signal that represents the entire patient or sample as a whole. But in imaging, we want more than that. We want to know the values of T-one and T-two for each pixel or voxel, not just the whole object. That requires us to encode spatial information.

That means if the overall field is stronger, the M vector — or you can think of it as a spinning top — will process faster.\n\nSo just follow the picture here. The last line is very clear: the angular frequency of precession, omega, is proportional to the local magnetic field. If we call the main field B-naught, then omega is proportional to B-naught.

That would not allow us to distinguish one location from another.\nBut if we apply a gradient field, we change the situation. The magnetic field strength will now depend on position. For example, the larger the z-coordinate, the stronger the field. As a result, the processional frequency will also depend on position.\n\nSo now, instead of all spins having the same frequency, their frequency varies with location. At z equals zero, the frequency is the original B-naught frequency.

That’s the same idea. You have to push the door at just the right time to keep it moving smoothly. Similarly, you have to push the spins at just the right frequency to change their orientation.\nAnd even earlier, we watched a short video where the instructor explained how an MRI works in less than ten minutes. He said you simply send in an RF frequency signal. That RF signal, or RF pulse, is a form of electromagnetic wave. And electromagnetic waves are oscillating magnetic fields.\n\nSo when you send in an RF pulse whose frequency is in resonance with the processional frequency of the spins, you are effectively pushing those tiny spinning tops — the protons — in a coordinated way. With each push, you tilt the magnetization vector a little more, and eventually you flip the M vector from its original orientation along the z-axis into one of the horizontal axes, like the x-axis or y-axis.\n\nNow, here’s the key: you don’t want to flip every proton in the body. You only want to flip the spins in a specific slice of tissue. To do that, you must use both the gradient field and the bandwidth of your RF pulse together.\nThe frequency range of the RF pulse is centered at some frequency, call it omega-s, and it spans from omega-s minus delta-omega-s to omega-s plus delta-omega-s. So it has a certain bandwidth.\n\nIn the time domain, this looks like a rectangular pulse — a signal that is “on” for a finite duration. When you take the Fourier transform, that rectangular pulse in the time domain becomes a sinc-shaped function in the frequency domain. So, in practice, even though you are sending an RF signal in the time domain that looks like a sinc function, in the frequency domain it corresponds to a rectangular function.\n\nThis rectangular frequency band means that only those spins whose processional frequencies fall within that band will be excited. Now recall, because of the gradient field, the processional frequency depends on z-location. So different positions along the z-axis correspond to different resonance frequencies.\nTherefore, when you send in your RF pulse with its defined bandwidth, only the spins whose z-positions correspond to that frequency band will resonate and be flipped. Spins outside that band will not be affected — they simply won’t respond, because the RF pulse is not in resonance with them.\n\nSo, the slice thickness directly corresponds to the frequency range of the RF pulse under the influence of the gradient field. If you make the bandwidth larger, the slice thickness increases. If you make the bandwidth smaller, the slice thickness decreases.\nTo summarize: you apply a gradient field to make the processional frequency vary with z-location. Then you send in an RF pulse with a defined frequency band. Only those spins in the matching z-range — that slice — are excited and flipped. Everything outside remains untouched. That is how slice selection in MRI works", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

In your textbook, you’ll find this figure, labeled as 4.16. Here, you see that slice selection can be performed using gradients along the x-axis, the y-axis, or the z-axis. That means you can select a coronal slice, an axial slice, or a sagittal slice, depending on which gradient you apply.\nAnd the beauty of MRI is that you are not limited to just these orthogonal planes. With the right gradient combinations, you can select slices at any orientation you like, even oblique slices at odd angles. This is one of the great flexibilities of MRI imaging.\n\nNow let’s think about why this matters. Before we introduced gradient fields, all we could do was measure T1 and T2 signals from the whole sample — essentially, we had no spatial specificity. We were only getting the overall relaxation properties averaged over the entire tissue volume. But now, with slice selection, we can be much more specific.\n\nWe can tell the scanner: “Excite this slice only.” That means the signals we collect come from just that defined region. All the other spins, those outside of the slice — whether they’re above, below, or to the side — will not contribute. Because remember, resonance is only defined for those spins whose frequencies match the selected RF bandwidth, which corresponds to the gradient-defined slice.\n\nSo in practice, the signals from outside the slice, those spins located elsewhere, remain silent. Only the spins inside that slice range are excited and measured. This is the principle of slice selection in MRI.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Instead, it varies linearly across space. But remember, any deviation from a homogeneous magnetic field introduces a problem: it causes dephasing.\n\nLet’s break this down. On the right-hand side of the diagram, you see the gradient field. On one side, the magnetic field is a little stronger. On the other side, it is a little weaker. Stronger fields correspond to faster precession. Weaker fields correspond to slower precession.\nSo when you look across the entire slice, the spins are no longer processing together in sync. Some spins are ahead, some are behind. If you just add all these signals together, they partially cancel each other out. The result is a substantial reduction in signal strength. That’s the dephasing problem.\nSo how do we fix it? We use what’s called a rephasing gradient.\n\nHere’s the idea: within the slice, after you’ve applied the slice-select gradient, the spins have accumulated different phases. That is described mathematically in your textbook by equation 4.41. The phase shift depends on the z-position and on the gradient strength.\nBut notice the formula includes tau over 2, not tau. Why is it tau divided by 2? Well, think about it this way: during the full pulse duration tau, the spins at the top of the slice accumulate the maximum phase, and the spins at the bottom accumulate the opposite phase. The middle spins are only halfway through. So if you take the average phase across the slice, it corresponds to tau divided by 2. That’s why this factor appears.\n\nNow, to correct for this unwanted dephasing, we apply a second gradient — but this time with opposite polarity. We call it the rephasing gradient. It lasts for a short time, tau-ref, and its strength is chosen so that the overall effect cancels the earlier phase spread.\nMathematically, the product of gradient strength and time for this rephasing pulse must equal tau over 2 times the original gradient strength. That’s equation 4.42 in your textbook.\nThe result is that the spins, which had drifted apart in phase, are brought back into alignment. This cancels out the artificial dephasing caused by the slice-selection gradient itself.\n\nSo now, within the slice, you’re left with a clean signal. The signal strength, mathematically, is proportional to the number of spins inside the slice. That’s why the formula is written as a double integral over x and y within the slice. It represents the total proton density summed across the slice area.\nThis is a big improvement. Without slice selection, we had a triple integral over x, y, and z — the entire volume. But now, we’ve reduced it to just two dimensions, a double integral. This means our signal comes only from the selected slice, not the whole volume.\n\nThat’s a huge step forward. But it’s still not the final goal. Because in imaging, we don’t just want the sum over the entire slice. We want to know the signal at each individual pixel or voxel. We want to resolve spatial detail — what is the proton density, the T1, or the T2 value at each location. That’s what we’ll cover in the next part.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

And I’ll be honest, it’s also one of the trickiest. So I strongly encourage you to review this multiple times, both in the textbook and in these lectures.\nThe idea is this: when we add gradient encoding — both phase encoding and frequency encoding — the MRI signal we measure naturally corresponds to a Fourier transform of the object we’re imaging.\n\nSo the scanner doesn’t measure an image directly. Instead, it measures data in k-space, which is essentially the Fourier space of the image. Then, by applying the Fourier transform, we reconstruct the actual image in spatial coordinates.\nThis concept is formalized in what we call the k-space theorem. And as you’ll see, the k-space theorem in MRI is directly analogous to the Fourier slice theorem we studied earlier for X-ray computed tomography.\n\nSo, in summary: slice selection gave us spatial specificity along one axis. Rephasing gradients fixed the signal within that slice. And now, sampling in k-space gives us the ability to encode and reconstruct every pixel inside the slice.

But instead of just getting a collective signal from all the protons in the selected slice, our goal is to resolve individual locations inside that slice.\n\nWe want to know: what is the proton density, often called rho, at a given pixel location? What is the T1 relaxation time for that pixel? What is the T2 relaxation time for that pixel? Once you know all this information, pixel by pixel, you can construct a cross-sectional image. And that is the true purpose of tomographic imaging.\n\nSo here’s the challenge. Let’s pause for a moment and think carefully. We have an equation — you can see it here — which tells us that the signal is proportional to the sum over all spins inside the slice. That’s already an improvement. It’s much more specific than before, when we were averaging over the whole volume. Now, the signal comes only from one slice.\n\nBut here’s the puzzle: how can we take this equation, which only tells us the total signal from the slice, and somehow extract the spatial information pixel by pixel? How can we single out, for example, the value of rho, or T1, or T2, at a particular coordinate — say, x naught, y naught?\nI encourage you to really think about this problem. Imagine you are designing the experiment yourself. How would you go about resolving the spatial information? \n\nHow would you separate the contributions from different locations within the slice?\nThere are actually multiple ways to approach this. The method I’m going to explain to you is very elegant and very efficient, but it’s not the only possibility. So think independently: if you were faced with this challenge, how would you do it?\n\nThe solution we use in MRI is to introduce phase encoding and frequency encoding.

It’s like hearing a classroom of students speaking at once, all in the same pitch. You know there are many voices, but you can’t separate them.\nSo how do we make progress? We apply a gradient encoding along one direction of the slice. This gradient is turned on for a certain amount of time. What happens then?\n\nAt the beginning, before the gradient is applied, all the spins are in phase. But once the gradient is turned on, the magnetic field is no longer the same everywhere. At one location, say at the top, the field is a little weaker. At another location, maybe lower down, the field is stronger.\nBecause precession frequency depends on field strength, the spins at different locations accumulate different amounts of phase shift over that same time interval.\nWhere the field is weak, the spins process more slowly.\nWhere the field is strong, the spins process more quickly.\nAnd since the gradient is linear, the phase difference grows proportionally with position.\n\nSo, after the gradient pulse, spins at the top may have accumulated only a small phase change, while spins at the bottom may have accumulated a large phase change, maybe even 180 degrees.\nNow, when you collect the signal, you know that spins with little or no phase shift must have come from one end of the slice, and spins with larger phase shifts must have come from the other end.\n\nThis is the essence of phase encoding. You haven’t fully reconstructed the image yet, but you now have row-wise spatial information. It’s like being able to say, “That sound came from the front row, or the middle row, or the back row,” even if you don’t yet know exactly which student was speaking.\nPhase encoding is the first step toward resolving spatial information inside the slice.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Mathematically, it’s the product of frequency and time. But remember, the local processional frequency is proportional to the local magnetic field. And the local magnetic field is not uniform — it’s linearly changing because of the applied gradient.\n\nSo we can write the local field as gamma times G y, times y. That is, the gradient strength G y, multiplied by the coordinate y, times the gyromagnetic ratio gamma.\nThis means the accumulated phase factor depends directly on position y. Spins at different y locations accumulate different phase shifts during the same encoding time. So after phase encoding, if you collect the signal, it still comes from the same slice, but now it’s modulated by this spatially dependent phase factor. That gives you extra information.\n\nTo put it simply, now you can resolve the signal line by line across the slice. You’re no longer dealing with one lumped signal. Instead, you can tell which “row” in the slice contributed to the measured data. Of course, this is not yet a full tomographic image. What we want is pixel-wise resolution — knowing the value at every point in the slice. Phase encoding alone only gives us line-by-line information.

After we finish phase encoding, we do not immediately record any signal. At that stage, the information is already encoded into the spins as phase shifts, but the signal is not read out yet. The next step is to apply what we call the frequency-encoding gradient, often denoted as G-sub-s, or simply the readout gradient. Once this gradient is applied, we begin recording the MR signal.\n\nWhat happens here is that the local magnetic field is no longer homogeneous. Instead, because of the gradient, the magnetic field strength changes linearly across the imaging plane. On the right-hand side, the field is stronger, and on the left-hand side, the field is weaker. This change in field strength directly affects the processional frequency of the spins. Spins that sit in regions of higher field will process faster, while those in lower field regions will process more slowly. This is a very clever way to extract spatial information from the signal.\n\nNow, when we measure the signal, if we see a component oscillating at a very high frequency, we know that signal must have come from spins located on the right-hand side of the image, where the field is strongest. Conversely, if the signal oscillates at a lower frequency, we know it must have come from the left-hand side, where the field is weaker. In other words, the frequency of the signal directly encodes the spatial position of the spins along the direction of the gradient.\n\nSo, the field is no longer uniform across the entire plane. Instead, the gradient introduces a mapping between position and frequency. The faster oscillations in the measured signal correspond to spins located toward the right side, while the slower oscillations correspond to spins on the left side. All of the low-frequency signals come from the left-hand side of the slice, and all of the high-frequency signals come from the right-hand side. By combining this frequency information with the phase information we already stored in the earlier phase-encoding step, we can now determine not only which row the signal came from, but also which column.

The phase angle that you see here carries important spatial meaning. Spins at the top of the slice accumulate a smaller phase angle, while spins at the bottom accumulate a larger phase angle. So when you combine phase encoding with frequency encoding, you can start to separate the signals point by point within the slice. This is the basic idea of how we move from bulk signals to localized, pixel-specific information.\n\nYou may wonder, why do we need two more gradient fields? At the very beginning, we already used a slice-selection gradient — let’s say along the z-direction — to pick out one slice from the entire volume. But that only gives us localization in one dimension. To fully resolve the slice, we need to further encode along the other two directions: the y-direction for phase encoding, and the x-direction for frequency encoding. By applying gradients step by step, we gradually eliminate one dimension at a time. Slice selection removes the z-dimension, phase encoding handles the y-dimension, and frequency encoding takes care of the x-dimension. The end result is three-dimensional, point-specific localization of the MR signal. This is the foundation of tomographic imaging.\n\nMathematically, we can describe this process using the equations shown here. If we only apply frequency encoding without phase encoding, the acquired signal is expressed as an integral over the slice that includes a factor of “e to the minus j gamma G-x times x times t.” This captures spatial frequency information along the x-direction. But when we combine both phase encoding and frequency encoding, the signal equation becomes the one you see at the bottom of the slide. Here, you have an additional factor of “e to the minus j gamma G-y times y times tau p-e.” This accounts for the phase encoding gradient applied in the y-direction for a certain time tau p-e.\n\nNow, looking at this combined equation, you can see it resembles a Fourier transformation. You have terms in both the x and y directions — frequency terms in x, and phase terms in y. Together, they allow us to map spatial coordinates into measurable signal space. This is the mathematical backbone of MRI imaging. We will go deeper into this Fourier interpretation later in the lecture. But for now, recognize that the combination of slice selection, phase encoding, and frequency encoding provides us with true point-wise information. Graphically, as shown here, this is exactly how the imaging sequence works.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The process begins with a ninety-degree pulse. This radiofrequency pulse flips the magnetization vector, the big M vector, into the x-y plane. Once it is in the x-y plane, the transverse components begin to process, and these processing components induce an alternating magnetic field around the patient or the sample. That alternating field is what we measure as the MR signal.\n\nNow, you want to make sure that you are not flipping every spin in the body. You only want to flip the spins within a single slice. That is where slice selection comes in. During the ninety-degree pulse, you apply a slice selection gradient. This gradient ensures that only the spins that are resonant within that slice frequency range are flipped into the x-y plane. Spins outside the slice are not flipped, and so they do not contribute to the signal. This is the first major step — slice selection removes one dimension, narrowing the signal to a single slice.\n\nNext, you apply phase encoding. On the slide, you see these multiple horizontal lines under the label “G-phase.” This is because phase encoding must be repeated multiple times with different gradient strengths. You can start from a minimum value, then gradually increase step by step, covering a full range of gradient amplitudes. Each phase encoding step imprints a different spatially dependent phase shift onto the spins along the y-direction. Why do we need so many lines? The reason is the Fourier transformation. To fully reconstruct an image, we need information along two degrees of freedom — one for the phase dimension and one for the frequency dimension. Each phase encoding line is like collecting one row of data in Fourier space, which we call k-space.\n\nAfter that, we apply frequency encoding, shown here as “G-freq.” Frequency encoding happens during the readout. With this gradient on, different spatial locations along the x-direction correspond to different precession frequencies. When you record the signal, you collect a series of oscillations that map into the x-axis of k-space. Each readout provides you with N data points along this horizontal axis.\n\nSo, putting everything together: for each phase encoding step, you collect one frequency-encoded readout with N data points. After repeating this process with many different phase encoding steps, you end up with a full grid of data — N by N points. Each row comes from one phase encoding, and each column comes from the frequency encoding readout. Altogether, this maps the entire cross-section of the slice into k-space. Then, by applying a two-dimensional Fourier transform, you reconstruct the final image.\n\nThis is the essence of Fourier imaging, or what we call k-space formulation in MRI. Slice selection removes one dimension, phase encoding handles the y-dimension, and frequency encoding handles the x-dimension. The result is a complete two-dimensional image of the selected slice, pixel by pixel.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The signal is proportional to the factors k x times x and k y times y, and this immediately shows that the signal we measure is essentially a Fourier transformation. For any fixed time point during readout, the time t sets a specific value of k x, while k y is determined by the strength of the gradient G y and the duration of the phase-encoding step, tau p e. In other words, the frequency-encoding factor is traced out by letting time run during readout, which sweeps continuously along one line in k-space, while the phase encoding only gives one value of k y per line, and this is why we need multiple phase-encoding steps. By repeating the experiment with many different gradient strengths for G y, we can step through multiple values of k y, gradually filling the two-dimensional k-space. This is the basis of Fourier imaging.\n\nOn the slide, you can see the formal definitions written explicitly: k x equals gamma over two pi times G x times t, and k y equals gamma over two pi times G y times tau p e. Substituting these into the signal equation, we get that S of k x, k y is proportional to the double integral over the slice of rho of x comma y times e to the minus j two pi times open parenthesis k x x plus k y y close parenthesis d x d y. This is shown as equation four point four nine, and it is the central mathematical statement of Fourier MRI. Notice that in your textbook, the two pi factor is missing inside the exponential, and this is actually a common oversight in many texts, including mine and in my lectures. In reality, the two pi must be included to match the conventional definition of the Fourier transform, so keep that in mind as a small but important detail.\n\nThe essential point here is that, through phase encoding and frequency encoding, the data we measure in MRI are already Fourier components. This is very different from X-ray imaging, where the Fourier slice theorem has to be used: there, each projection profile must be one-dimensionally transformed to draw a radial line in Fourier space, and extra processing is needed. In MRI, the signals themselves directly populate k-space, which means the Fourier information is collected naturally as part of the measurement. Each phase-encoding step contributes to the vertical direction in k-space, and the continuous readout under the frequency-encoding gradient sweeps across the horizontal direction. By combining both, we directly fill k-space, and after applying the inverse Fourier transform, we reconstruct the final image.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

When time t equals zero, the k value is also zero, which means you are sitting right at the center of k-space. As time increases during the frequency encoding readout, the trajectory moves gradually toward the right-hand side along the k x direction. In this way, you begin to cover half of the Fourier domain. Now remember, for real-valued functions, the Fourier transform has a very useful symmetry property: if you only collect data from one half of k-space, the other half can be inferred mathematically. This symmetry reduces the amount of data we need, but in practice, MRI systems still often collect both halves to account for noise and to achieve cleaner reconstructions.\n\nThis diagram shows how the data lines are filled. Each horizontal line corresponds to a readout under the frequency-encoding gradient, which traces across k x. After finishing one line, you step the phase-encoding gradient to a new value, moving up or down in the k y direction, and then record another frequency-encoded line. So, for example, line one at the bottom corresponds to the maximum negative value of the phase-encoding gradient. Then you step gradually upward, line by line, until you reach the maximum positive value of k y. The spacing between these lines is delta k y, and the spacing along the frequency-encoding direction is delta k x. By repeating this process, you fill up the entire k-space grid point by point, line by line.\n\nThis is why we call it k-space: each coordinate, k x and k y, corresponds to a Fourier component of the image. Once the k-space is fully sampled, an inverse Fourier transform is applied, and that directly reconstructs the image in the spatial domain. So the essential idea is very simple but very powerful: MRI does not record the image directly. Instead, it records data in k-space, which is really the Fourier space, and then uses the inverse transform to bring everything back into an image we can see.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

If we look at this figure, you can see how we can slightly modify the pulse sequence to make sure the entire k-space is covered symmetrically. Normally, during frequency encoding, you simply start your data collection right away. That means your measurement begins at time t equal to zero, so the k x trajectory also starts at zero and moves only into the positive side. This means, by default, you are not covering the negative part of k-space.\n\nSo how do we fix this? Before the regular frequency encoding and data acquisition, we apply what is called a dephasing gradient. This is shown here as G dephase. By applying this dephasing pulse, we effectively shift the starting point of the k x trajectory into the negative region. In other words, instead of starting at zero, all the frequency components now begin with a negative k x value. Then, as time increases during the readout, the trajectory sweeps across k-space and eventually moves into the positive side. By doing this, you cover the entire rectangular region of k-space, centered around the origin.\nThis is important because, according to the Nyquist sampling theorem, you need to cover the full bandwidth of frequencies to accurately reconstruct the image. If your sampling region is too narrow, you will miss some Fourier components, and that leads to aliasing or artifacts in the reconstructed image. By carefully choosing the dephasing and rephasing gradients, you make sure that this rectangular region in k-space is wide enough to include all of the significant Fourier components of the object.\n\nSo the essential idea here is that MRI imaging works in k-space, and by adjusting the gradient pulses — dephasing first, then rephasing with frequency encoding — you can guarantee full coverage. This is how the k-space theorem is applied in MRI. And remember, in our setup, phase encoding is along the vertical direction, while frequency encoding is along the horizontal direction. Together, they fill the k-space grid, ensuring that the reconstructed image contains all the spatial information of the object.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Here, tau, shown in green, is the time you spend applying the phase-encoding gradient. During this phase encoding, you introduce a phase difference across the spins, but you are not yet collecting any signal. After that, you let time t run, shown in red, and that is when you actually begin collecting the MR signal. This is the formulation with both phase encoding and frequency encoding included.\n\nWe first perform phase encoding longitudinally, then we do frequency encoding horizontally. But in fact, you can do this in different ways. You can apply gradients in both the vertical and horizontal directions simultaneously. When you do this, during the time tau, you move the starting phase point diagonally in k-space, depending on the relative strengths of the gradients. If you then start collecting signal immediately, the k-space trajectory begins from that shifted point. Alternatively, you might first move the starting point horizontally by applying one gradient, then switch to a vertical gradient and move to another position, and only then begin collecting the signal. Each different choice changes the trajectory you trace in k-space.\n\nFor example, if you use an x gradient for frequency encoding, then as time t increases from zero, the k x value changes continuously toward positive values. If instead you first apply a horizontal gradient as a phase-encoding step, the initial point shifts along the k x axis. Then, by applying a vertical gradient, you move the starting point vertically. Once you begin signal acquisition, you trace a horizontal or vertical line in k-space. Finally, if you apply both gradients at once and immediately collect the signal, you start at the origin and move along a straight line at a slope determined by the ratio of the two gradients.\n\nThe essential idea is that whenever you collect a signal with a gradient on, the frequency of precession is shifted, and that frequency determines the trajectory in k-space. If you apply a gradient without collecting a signal, the spins accumulate phase instead. By combining these options, you can navigate k-space in virtually any pattern. This flexibility is what allows MRI to encode spatial information and build an image slice by slice, pixel by pixel.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

If you basically follow the logical flow so far, you can feel confident. If you are quite confused, that’s also expected — because these concepts are tricky and require repeated review. If you’re somewhere in between, that’s normal too. The important thing is not to get discouraged.

Spin echo is a very clever but also highly simplified signal model. In this figure, you can see the sequence step by step. You begin with the magnetization vector aligned along the z-axis. Then you apply a 90-degree pulse, which flips the vector into the transverse plane — here shown along the y-axis, though it could just as well be flipped along the x-axis depending on how the pulse is applied.\n\nOnce in the transverse plane, the spins begin to dephase because of local field inhomogeneities. Some spins process slightly faster, and others slightly slower. Over time, this produces a spread in phase, as shown here. Then comes the magic step: a 180-degree pulse is applied. This pulse flips the spins over, so that those that were lagging are now ahead, and those that were ahead are now behind. From that point forward, the phase differences begin to refocus. After the same amount of time has passed, the spins come back into alignment, forming an echo.\n\nThis is the echo signal that can be detected by the coil. Importantly, this echo arises from the selected slice, assuming you have already applied slice selection. The equation shown here, equation 4.43, expresses the signal mathematically as being proportional to the integral of the proton density over the slice. In other words, the echo represents the combined contribution of all the spins in that slice, after refocusing has occurred.\nSo spin echo illustrates in a very clear way how we can recover useful signal despite dephasing, and how gradients and RF pulses can be combined to control the evolution of magnetization in MRI.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

After applying a ninety-degree RF pulse, the net magnetization vector is flipped into the transverse plane. This transverse component of magnetization is constantly rotating around the main magnetic field, B zero. Because of this precession, the changing magnetic field induces an alternating electromagnetic field. And as you learned in high school physics, an alternating magnetic field induces an electric current in a nearby coil. So if we place a receiver coil close to the patient, that coil will detect this alternating signal. \n\nHowever, the signal does not last forever. It decays over time, and this decay is due to the T2-star relaxation. The spins gradually lose phase coherence, and the signal amplitude decreases exponentially. What we record is not a constant sine wave of fixed amplitude, but a damped oscillation that fades away with time. This decaying signal, directly measured from the whole sample, or from a whole slice if slice selection is applied, is the free induction decay, or FID. This is the fundamental NMR signal we detect in MRI.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Two very important parameters in MRI are TE and TR. TE stands for echo time, which is the time from the application of the RF pulse to the moment we collect the peak of the echo signal. TR stands for repetition time, which is the time between successive RF excitations. You see in this diagram that we often use a ninety-degree pulse followed by a one-eighty-degree refocusing pulse to generate a spin echo. The echo forms at time TE. TR is measured from one excitation pulse to the next. \n\nThese two parameters, TE and TR, are under our control. They are not properties of the tissue itself but technical choices we make during the imaging sequence. By carefully selecting TE and TR, we can emphasize different tissue contrasts, highlight T1 weighting, T2 weighting, or proton density weighting. And at the same time, we can also balance image quality with scan time. If TR is long, the magnetization has more time to recover, giving us strong signals, but the scan will take longer. If TR is short, scanning is faster, but some magnetization may not have fully recovered, which reduces the signal. TE works similarly: shorter echo times reduce T2 contrast but keep signal strong, while longer echo times allow more T2 differences to emerge but at the cost of weaker signals. These parameters, TE and TR, are the main levers we adjust to create different kinds of MRI contrast.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Then, if you place another coil, you can also get a signal. Remember, the horizontal component of the magnetization is a rotational vector. So the signal actually has two parts. It depends both on amplitude and on phase. The signal detected along the x-axis and the signal detected along the y-axis naturally have a ninety-degree phase difference, because the magnetization keeps rotating. That makes the signal a complex-valued quantity.\n\nSo, let’s describe it mathematically. You can record Sx, which is modulated as M zero. After a ninety-degree pulse, this transverse signal is subject to spin echo formation and also subject to T2 decay. The Sx term represents the amplitude and the frequency content along the x-axis. Likewise, you have a Sy component, which is just the complementary sine term. Together, these two components give you both cosine and sine contributions. If we put them into compact form, we can write the signal as a complex number: a real part and an imaginary part. This gives us a very compact, complex-valued signal representation. In this notation, I have chosen to place the imaginary part corresponding to Sy. This is just a convention. The coding system can be chosen differently. Here, I simply make Sy the imaginary component. But for physical measurement, both the real part and the imaginary part are equally meaningful. We use complex notation mainly for convenience.\n\nThis idea is similar to what we saw in Fourier series and Fourier transforms, where using a complex exponential makes the notation compact, but the actual measured signal is real. Any complex form can always be converted back into a purely real form if needed.\nNow, the processional frequency is omega zero, determined by the main field B zero. The transverse magnetization keeps processing at this angular frequency omega zero. If we use a rotating frame—meaning we mentally rotate our coordinate system at the same frequency as the spins—then the signal appears stationary. In the rotating frame, the oscillatory part is removed, and the signal just decays exponentially with T2. This makes the description much simpler.\nSo, this is the signal in the rotating frame: stationary, but still decaying, due to T2 relaxation. And remember, T two decay is a physiological property. We cannot control it; it reflects interactions within the tissue itself.\n\nNow, what about repetition? The MRI sequence is repeated after a certain repetition time, TR. If TR is not long enough, the longitudinal magnetization, M zero, has not fully recovered. T1 relaxation determines how much of the original longitudinal magnetization is available at the start of the next cycle. So, after TR, the signal amplitude depends on both T1 recovery and T2 decay.\nThe total signal at time t is therefore a combination of these factors: proton density, hidden inside M zero; T1 recovery, which determines how much longitudinal magnetization has returned; and T2 decay, which determines how fast the transverse signal fades. Together, these biological properties determine tissue contrast.\nOn top of that, we have technical parameters: B zero, the main magnetic field; TR, the repetition time; and TE, the echo time. These are under our control. They don’t reflect patient pathology, but our technical choices in the scan.\n\nNow, why do we need repetition in the first place? Recall that in phase encoding, each time you collect data, you only get one line in k-space. Frequency encoding samples along that line, but since k-space is two-dimensional, you need multiple phase-encoding steps. That means repeating the sequence many times. This is very much like CT scanning, where helical scanning or fan-beam scanning requires repeated projections. In MRI, k-space must be filled line by line, and that requires repetition.\n\nIf TR is very long, M zero is fully recovered between repetitions. That gives you clean, strong signals, but scanning takes longer. If TR is too short, M zero hasn’t fully recovered, so the signal is weaker. But shorter TR also means faster scanning. So there is a tradeoff: longer TR improves image quality, shorter TR reduces scan time. The goal is always to balance scan speed with image quality for the clinical application.\n\nFinally, both TR and TE can be adjusted to emphasize different tissue properties. A short TR and short TE give you T1-weighted images. A long TR and long TE give you T2-weighted images. Proton density weighting lies somewhere in between. So, this signal model for a ninety-degree pulse captures both the biological properties of tissue—proton density, T1, and T2—and the technical factors—B zero, TR, TE, and time. Together, they shape the MRI signal and ultimately determine the image contrast.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

You can use short TE or long TE. And with different combinations, your image can reflect more about rho, about T1, or about T2. So with different combinations, you measure different parameters. This is not like CT, where you only measure the attenuation coefficient, mu. In MRI, you have T1, you have T2, and you have rho, the proton density. If you just do one measurement, one kind of image, then the image really reflects all of these parameters mixed together. But if you purposely want to emphasize one of the three parameters, you need to select the proper technical parameters.\n\nSo first, let me explain what I mean by long TR. TR is the time for repetition. If you wait long enough after each excitation, the m vector will return to the original position along the z-axis. So M0 aligns with the z-axis. That is what we mean by long TR. Long TR means the magnetization has had enough time to fully recover. Short TR means you do not give the system enough time, so the full value of M0 has not yet been recovered along the z-axis. That’s the meaning of long TR and short TR.\nNow let’s talk about TE, the echo time. What do we mean by short TE? Short TE means the echo time is very short. The spin echo is collected quickly, so the flipped M vector doesn’t have enough time to dephase. Because the echo is measured soon after flipping, the dephasing is not serious. So M xy, the transverse component after the 90-degree flip, has had very little time to dephase. That means there is no significant T2 effect. If you measure the signal with a short TE, you cannot tell how much T2 contributes, because T2 hasn’t had enough time to show its effect.\n\nNow, if you use a long TR, then the magnetization has fully recovered. That means you have no information about T1, because T1 does not play a role when you wait long enough. If you use short TR, the recovery along the z-axis is incomplete. In that case, the effect you observe depends on the degree of recovery of the longitudinal component, so you see the T1 effect. That’s why short TR with short TE is called T1-weighted imaging.\nNext, if you use long TE, the echo time is long enough for T2 decay to take effect. And if you also use long TR, so the longitudinal magnetization has fully recovered, then there is no T1 effect. In this case, the signal is dominated by T2 decay, so it is T2-weighted. That is shown here with the green arrow.\n\nNow, if you use long TR and short TE together, then there is no T1 effect, and no T2 effect. In that case, the signal is proportional to rho, the proton density, because you are basically measuring the full magnetization without either T1 or T2 altering it. That is called rho-weighted imaging.\nThere is also a combination shown here with short TR and long TE, but that is not possible in practice. Remember, TR is the repetition time, and TE is the echo time within that repetition. TE normally should not be longer than TR. So this case does not exist physically.\n\nSo, to summarize: short TR and short TE give you T1-weighted imaging, long TR and long TE give you T2-weighted imaging, and long TR with short TE gives you rho-weighted imaging. Again, this takes time for you to fully understand. And if this is your first time seeing it, it is natural to feel a little confused.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

On the same slide, you can see three different types of images: rho-weighted, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted. In MRI, rho here means proton density weighting, not P-weighted. In the brain, there are mainly five important tissue types that we care about: grey matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid or CSF, blood, and water. If you look carefully at the table, you’ll notice that the T1 and T2 relaxation times are quite different for each tissue. \n\nFor example, grey matter has a T1 of about 1 second and a T2 of about 0.1 seconds, while CSF has a much longer T1 of around 2 seconds and a T2 of around 0.25 seconds. Water has even longer values, T1 about 4.7 seconds and T2 about 3.5 seconds. These differences are the key to MRI contrast. The very same slice of the brain can look dramatically different depending on whether you emphasize proton density, T1, or T2 weighting. \n\nSo, depending on your imaging parameters, you can choose to highlight different tissue characteristics. This is something CT cannot do, because CT only measures the attenuation coefficient mu. But MRI gives us much richer information because of rho, T1, and T2. And for a special case, we can use Gx gradient encoding to separate frequencies along the x-axis.

This gives the overall signal strength at each location. Then, with the Gx gradient, we impose a position-dependent frequency shift. That’s why the exponential factor here involves Gx times x. \n\nSo, summarizing: the total signal is complex, but you can think of it as having two parts — the amplitude of the local signal, determined by rho, T1, and T2, and the frequency of the local signal, determined by the gradient. This separation is very useful because it tells us what portion of the signal comes from tissue properties, and what portion comes from our encoding scheme.

The signal of t, the thing we actually measure, is the Fourier transform of f of x and y, evaluated along the kx axis. \n\nSo in this case, we are scanning a single line in k-space, the horizontal line, because the gradient field is only along x. \n\nThis is a very special case, but it makes the principle clear: our signal directly corresponds to the Fourier components of the object we are imaging.

Instead of just Gx, we allow general gradients along x, y, and z. These gradients can vary with time, and their effects accumulate as the spins process. The local precession frequency is determined by the inner product of the gradient vector G of t and the position vector r. When we integrate this over time, we get a phase factor that builds up gradually. This leads us to define k of t as gamma over 2 pi times the time integral of G of tau d tau. \n\nIn other words, k of t is a trajectory through Fourier space, controlled entirely by our choice of gradient waveforms. The measured signal s of t is then the Fourier transform of the object’s spin density, f of x, y, z, evaluated along this k-space trajectory. This is the k-space theorem. It tells us that by designing gradient waveforms, we can sample any path we want in k-space — straight lines, zig-zags, spirals, anything. That’s why MRI is so flexible.

Where exactly do the approximations come in? There are really three places. \n\nFirst, if you look at this expression, you see that the function depends on time, t. But when we talk about the k-space theorem, we treat it as if the whole function is fixed in space, something like F of x, y, z, and not time-varying. In reality, there is a time dependence here, and when we ignore that, we are making an approximation. \n\nSecond, you see this vector r, the positional vector. We treat it as if it is constant, fixed in space. But in reality, spins may move. For example, spins in blood keep moving. Patients may also move. Even molecular motion introduces some effects. But in this model, we ignore those motions and assume r is constant. That is another approximation. And third, the factor related to signal decay. \n\nIn practice, the signal we measure is subject to T2 star decay. But in this approximation, we assume that the readout is fast enough, so that no significant T2 star decay occurs during acquisition. That is a third approximation. Under these assumptions, the formulation reduces neatly to a Fourier transformation, which makes image reconstruction straightforward. But if you want very accurate imaging, all these neglected factors must be included. And once you include them, the reconstruction is no longer a simple Fourier transform. It becomes much more complex. \n\nIn fact, this is an area where machine learning and advanced reconstruction methods can play a big role. In the last part of the course, I will mention how modern approaches are being used to solve these challenges.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Remember, the Fourier transform is a complex function. It has both amplitude and phase. But what we display here is only the amplitude. It looks something like this, a distribution of intensities in k-space. \n\nThen, if you apply an inverse Fourier transformation, you obtain the image on the right, which is a cross-sectional image of the brain. So with MRI, by collecting data in k-space and applying an inverse Fourier transform, we can reconstruct detailed cross-sectional anatomy.

At the heart of the scanner, you have the patient placed inside the bore surrounded by gradient coils and the RF, or radiofrequency coil. The RF coil serves two purposes — it transmits the excitation pulses into the body, and it also receives the weak signals emitted back from the tissue. To generate those pulses, a frequency synthesizer and an RF amplifier create the correct radiofrequency signal. That signal is then sent through a transmit–receive switch, which ensures that the same RF coil can switch roles between sending and receiving.\n\nOnce the RF coil receives the returning signal, it is very weak. So the signal first goes through a preamplifier to boost it. Then, it passes through a receiver blanking unit to protect the electronics during transmission. After that, the signal is routed to an RF amplifier and a demodulator, followed by a quadrature mixer, which separates the signal into its real and imaginary components. These components represent the complex-valued MRI signal.\n\nThe analog signal is then converted into a digital form by an analog-to-digital, or A/D, converter. From there, the digital data is stored temporarily in RAM memory and controlled by the host computer. The computer performs the essential reconstruction step — the two-dimensional inverse Fourier transform, or 2-D IFFT. This is what converts raw k-space data into an actual image that can be displayed.\n\nOn the control side of the system, there are waveform generator timing boards and gradient amplifiers. These control the gradient coils inside the scanner, which are responsible for slice selection, phase encoding, and frequency encoding. The pulse programmer and software interface, also controlled by the computer, dictate exactly when and how these gradients and RF pulses are applied. Together, this timing sequence ensures precise spatial encoding of the MRI signal, allowing us to reconstruct high-resolution images.\n\nSo overall, this diagram gives us a complete picture: from the RF system and gradient amplifiers, to signal detection, digitization, Fourier reconstruction, and finally, the image display.

At the center, you see the patient lying on the patient table, which slides into the bore of the scanner. Surrounding the patient are several key components. Closest to the body are the radio frequency coils. These coils are responsible for transmitting the RF pulses that flip the spins inside the tissue, and also for receiving the weak signals emitted back from the patient. Without these coils, no imaging would be possible.\n\nJust outside the RF coils are the gradient coils. These coils are used to create small, linearly varying magnetic fields on top of the main magnetic field. By turning the gradient coils on and off in different directions, the scanner performs slice selection, phase encoding, and frequency encoding, which are the core steps that allow spatial localization of the MRI signal.\n\nEncasing the gradient coils is the large superconducting magnet, shown here as the main cylindrical structure of the scanner. This magnet produces the strong, uniform field we call B-zero, typically one and a half Tesla, three Tesla, or even higher in advanced systems.

In radiation oncology, precise targeting of tumors is critical because you want to deliver a very high radiation dose to cancer cells while sparing as much of the surrounding healthy tissue as possible. Traditionally, CT has been used for radiation planning because CT provides good information on patient anatomy and electron density, which are needed to calculate radiation dose. However, CT has limited soft-tissue contrast, which means tumors in organs like the brain, liver, or pelvis may be difficult to outline clearly.\n\nBy combining MRI with CT in radiation therapy, doctors can take advantage of the strengths of both modalities. MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast, allowing the tumor to be visualized more clearly, while CT provides the necessary density information for radiation dose calculation. This hybrid approach makes the targeting more accurate and safer.\n\nIn this photo, you see the treatment couch where the patient lies, with immobilization devices to keep the patient still. The large circular gantry houses the imaging and radiation components.

The design also includes a couch that can rotate by plus or minus twenty-five degrees, giving flexibility in patient positioning and beam delivery angles.\n\nThe circular ring you see provides both mechanical stability and magnet shielding.

By now, many of you have probably gone through the green book and have some familiarity with the hardware components of an MRI system. Let’s review these ideas together so you can build a stronger, more intuitive understanding.\n\nMRI imaging relies on both hardware and software. The hardware provides the physical foundation—magnets, gradient coils, and radio-frequency coils—while the software defines the pulse sequences, the inversion schemes, and the reconstruction algorithms that convert raw signals into images. Together, all these parts form what we call an MRI scanner.\nAt the heart of the scanner is a strong, stationary magnetic field, which we denote as B-zero. Inside this B-zero field, all the tiny magnetic moments in the body—what we call the magnetization vector, or M-vector—naturally align along the direction of B-zero, which we usually define as the z-axis or G-direction.\n\nNext, we introduce a radio-frequency field, called B-one. This is a rotating magnetic field applied perpendicular to B-zero. Because of this rotation, the B-one field exerts a torque on the M-vector, causing it to flip from its resting position toward the x-y plane. In other words, it moves the system from a stable, low-energy state to a higher-energy state.\nOnce magnetization has been flipped into the x-y plane, the spins begin to process, producing an alternating electromagnetic field. If we place detection coils near the sample—or the patient—this changing field induces an electrical signal known as the free-induction decay, or FID. That is the fundamental signal we detect in MRI.\n\nAfter excitation, the M-vector gradually relaxes back to its original, low-energy position aligned with the B-zero field. This relaxation process releases energy, and we can monitor it to extract physical and biological information.\n\nNow, this M-vector is not a single magnet; it represents the collective effect of countless microscopic spins—some pointing slightly up, some slightly down. The small imbalance between them adds up to produce a measurable net magnetization.\nIf we only used B-zero and B-one, we would get information about the entire sample as a whole—but no spatial localization. To achieve tomographic imaging, we need gradient coils that generate linearly varying magnetic fields, denoted G-x, G-y, and G-z. By controlling these gradients, we can selectively encode spatial information: G-z is typically used for slice selection, G-x for frequency encoding, and G-y for phase encoding. Together, these allow us to map the detected signals into k-space—a spatial-frequency domain that follows the Fourier-slice theorem. From there, we apply Fourier transforms and inverse Fourier transforms to reconstruct the final tomographic image.\n\nSo, the hardware provides the data, and the mathematics—mainly Fourier analysis—turns that data into images. This is a high-level overview of how MRI works. If you’ve already reviewed the textbook section on MRI scanner architecture, you should now recognize the key components we’re talking about.\nLet’s move on and look at these elements in more detail.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

When the magnetization vector — the M vector — is flipped by ninety degrees, it moves entirely into the X-Y plane. This gives us the maximum signal, because the transverse magnetization is now at its full strength.\n\nOnce in the X-Y plane, the M vector begins to rotate, or process, around the main magnetic field. This motion induces an electric current in the nearby quadrature coils, and that’s the MRI signal we detect. Because the magnetization both rotates and decays, the signal has two parts — an amplitude and a phase — so we describe it as a phasor.\n\nMathematically, we can write the two components like this:\u000bS-x of t equals M-naught times e to the power of negative t over T-two, times cosine of omega-naught times t.\u000bS-x of t equals M-naught times e to the power of negative t over T-two, times sine of omega-naught times t.\n\nIf we combine these two into one complex expression, we get: S of t equals S-x of t plus i times S-y of t, which is equal to M-naught times e to the power of negative t over T-two times e to the power of negative i omega-naught t. This compact form represents both the magnitude and the phase of the signal together. If you prefer real numbers, you could keep the sine and cosine forms separately, but the complex expression makes the math much easier—especially once we introduce phase encoding and frequency encoding later.\n\nIn the rotating reference frame, we remove the fast rotation caused by the main field B-zero, so the signal simplifies to: S of t equals M-naught times e to the power of negative t over T-two. This describes the exponential decay of the transverse magnetization—what we call T-two relaxation.\nWhen the sequence is repeated after a repetition time, or T-r, the magnetization recovers along the Z-axis following this relation: M-z of T-r equals M-naught times the quantity one minus e to the power of negative T-r over T-one.\n\nNow if we combine both effects—T-one recovery and T-two decay—the total signal becomes: S of t equals M-naught times the quantity one minus e to the power of negative T-r over T-one, all multiplied by e to the power of negative t over T-two. This signal depends on two groups of factors: biological parameters — proton density rho, T-one, and T-two — and technical parameters such as B-zero, T-r, T-e, and time t.\n\nWhat’s elegant here is how physics and mathematics come together. The sine and cosine functions we use are direct solutions of Maxwell’s equations, which describe electromagnetic fields. And when we add phase and frequency encoding, those same sinusoidal functions naturally form a Fourier representation—the mathematical tool we use to reconstruct MRI images.\n\nSo, Maxwell’s equations describe the physical interaction, and Fourier analysis provides the mathematical framework. Together, they create what we call the K-space theorem—a beautiful harmony between physics and mathematics that makes MRI imaging possible.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Let’s take a look at the overall MRI system diagram to understand how all these components work together.\nAt the very top level, the MRI scanner begins with a strong, static magnetic field, denoted as B-zero. This field provides the main alignment for all magnetic moments inside the body.\n\nTo this, we add a rotating magnetic field, called B-one, which is generated by the radio-frequency coil, or R-F coil for short. “R-F” stands for radio frequency, which corresponds to the Larmor frequency—the processional frequency of the spins.\nWhen the system applies this B-one field, the spins are excited, and the resulting signal is induced in the same coil placed nearby. Because the coil operates at the same resonant frequency, it can both transmit and receive the signal effectively.\n\nNow, let’s trace the signal path through the system. Everything begins at the host computer, which contains the control software. The computer sends pulse sequence commands to a pulse programmer or software interface. These commands are then passed to a waveform generator and timing boards, which create precise control signals for the gradient amplifiers and the frequency synthesizer.\n\nThe frequency synthesizer defines the exact frequency of the R-F pulse, and the R-F amplifier boosts that signal to a level strong enough to drive the R-F coil. Through the transmit–receive switch, the system alternates between sending energy into the body and listening for the returning signal.\n\nOn the receiving side, the weak magnetic resonance signal first passes through a preamplifier, which increases its strength without distorting it. Then it goes through receiver blanking—a brief muting step to prevent overload when the transmitter is active. Next, the signal passes through another R-F amplifier, a demodulator, and a quadrature mixer, which separate the real and imaginary components of the complex signal.\n\nThis analog signal is then converted into digital form using an A–D converter, meaning analog to digital converter, and the data are stored in the system’s memory, or RAM. From there, the computer performs a two-dimensional inverse fast Fourier transform, often abbreviated as two-D I-F-F-T, to reconstruct the spatial image from the frequency-domain data, also called k-space.\n\nFinally, the reconstructed image is displayed on the computer screen.\nSo, to summarize — you have the B-zero field providing magnetic alignment, the B-one field for excitation and signal detection, and the gradient fields for spatial encoding. All these are coordinated by computer software that carefully synchronizes every pulse and acquisition step.\nThis is a high-level overview of how an MRI system operates—from the initial excitation pulse all the way to the final image reconstruction.\nNext, we’ll dive a bit deeper into some of the hardware details behind these components.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

You don’t need to worry too much about the mathematical details here—think of this as a conceptual overview. The signal we receive from the patient contains both a real part and an imaginary part, and we often combine them into a complex form to make the analysis simpler.\n\nWhen we first learned about Fourier series, we started with real functions—things like sine and cosine. Later, we introduced complex notation, and suddenly the whole expression became much more compact, taking only about one-third of the space. That’s exactly what we’re doing here—it’s purely a mathematical convenience.\n\nSo, we have two components: the real signal, written as S-R of t, and the imaginary signal, written as S-I of t. When we combine them, the total signal can be expressed as: S of omega equals the integral from negative infinity to positive infinity of the quantity S-R of t plus j times S-I of t, multiplied by e to the power of negative j omega t, integrated with respect to t. This simply represents the Fourier transform of our signal, showing how it behaves across different frequencies.\n\nNow, in practical terms, the signal detected by the MRI coil is an oscillating voltage. For a typical 1.5-tesla scanner, this voltage oscillates at around 63.9 megahertz—that’s an extremely high frequency—and its strength is only a few microvolts. Because it’s so high and so weak, it’s very difficult to digitize the signal directly.\n\nTo make digitization possible, we first have to demodulate the signal—in other words, we shift it from that very high Larmor frequency down to a much lower intermediate frequency, usually around 10.7 megahertz.\nHere’s how that works: The analog signal coming from the preamplifier is sent into a demodulator, then through a quadrature mixer. The quadrature mixer separates the signal into two parts—often labeled “I” for the in-phase component, and “Q” for the quadrature, or ninety-degree phase-shifted, component. These two parts correspond to the real and imaginary signals we discussed earlier.\n\nAfter that, the signals pass through filters and variable-gain amplifiers to remove noise and adjust their strength. Finally, they go into two analog-to-digital converters, often called A–D converters, where the continuous analog signal is converted into discrete digital samples.\nOnce this conversion is done, the signal enters the digital domain—from there, the computer can perform all kinds of mathematical operations, such as Fourier transforms, image reconstruction, and signal averaging.\n\nSo, to summarize: the goal of this detection process is to convert a weak, high-frequency, analog signal into a lower-frequency, digital signal that can be handled by a computer. This step bridges the physical world of magnetic resonance with the digital world of image formation.\nThese are primarily electrical engineering concepts, but understanding them gives you a complete picture of how MRI signal acquisition really works.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

There are three main ways to generate this magnetic field inside an MRI system.\n\nThe mainstream approach, used in nearly all modern MRI scanners, is to use a superconducting magnet. This magnet operates in an extremely cold environment—close to absolute zero—so that the wire inside becomes superconductive, meaning it has zero electrical resistance. That’s quite remarkable, because once current starts flowing in a superconducting loop, it can continue indefinitely without any energy loss.\nIf a superconducting magnet is not used, the second option is a permanent magnet. Permanent magnets can be very effective and relatively inexpensive when the total field strength is low—typically below about zero point three five tesla. These are often used in open MRI systems or low-end scanners, where high field strength is not essential.\n\nThe third method is to use electromagnets made from copper coils, where electric current is continuously injected to generate the magnetic field. However, this method has major drawbacks: running current through the coils produces heat, which leads to noise and energy loss, making it inefficient and less stable for imaging.\n\nSo, among the three methods, the superconducting magnet remains the primary choice for modern MRI scanners. It provides a strong, stable, and uniform B-zero field, which is essential for producing high-quality images.\n\nIf you look at the cross-sectional illustration in your textbook, you’ll see how the magnet is constructed. At the center, we have the room-temperature magnet bore, where the patient lies. Surrounding it are layers containing the superconducting windings, which are immersed in liquid helium to keep them cold enough to maintain superconductivity. Outside that, there are layers of vacuum insulation and liquid nitrogen to minimize heat transfer from the environment.\n\nThe resulting magnetic field, B-zero, is oriented along the Z direction in our coordinate system, with X and Y lying perpendicular to it.\n\nSo, to summarize:\u000bSuperconducting magnets are the standard in modern MRI systems,\u000bPermanent magnets are used for low-field or open designs, and\u000bResistive magnets using copper coils are mostly historical or experimental.\nThese are the key ways we generate the powerful and stable B-zero field that makes MRI imaging possible.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

At the center is the main winding — a set of coils made from a special metal alloy. When this material is cooled to an extremely low temperature, its electrical resistance suddenly disappears. That’s what we call superconductivity.\nNormally, in any electrical circuit, a conductor always has some resistance — no matter how small. But once the temperature drops low enough, the resistance becomes exactly zero. That’s an amazing physical phenomenon. In fact, a professor from our own physics department many years ago did pioneering work on superfluidity and superconductivity, and his research earned a Nobel Prize. So, this topic has deep scientific roots right here on campus.\n\nIn this system, liquid helium is filled into the helium vessel to cool the main windings to superconducting temperatures. The outer layers include vacuum insulation and cold shields — both inner and outer — to prevent heat from entering the chamber. There are also shim coils used to fine-tune the uniformity of the magnetic field inside the bore. The entire setup is housed inside a metal casing to maintain stability and safety.\n\nWhen everything is working properly, a large current circulates continuously through the superconducting wire without any energy loss. That’s the key advantage — it’s energy efficient and can generate an extremely strong and stable magnetic field.\n\nNow, if you look at the first link provided on the slide, it explains more about this superconductive design in detail. The second link, written partly in English and partly in Chinese, was authored by one of my former postdoctoral fellows, Dr. Wei. He proposed a theoretical interpretation of superconductivity and superfluidity from a quantum-mechanical perspective.\n\nAs you may recall, in quantum mechanics, matter is treated as both a wave and a particle. According to the standard theory, the probability wave that describes where a particle might be found is always non-negative — it can be zero or positive, but never negative. Dr. Wei’s extension of the theory suggests that, under certain quantum conditions, the probability wave could actually take on negative values. That would mean a particle might seem to disappear in one region and reappear elsewhere instantly — a phenomenon sometimes described as quantum teleportation.\n\nOf course, whether this interpretation is physically real is still open to debate, but it offers a fascinating theoretical connection between quantum behavior and macroscopic phenomena like superconductivity and superfluidity.\n\nSo, to summarize: in a superconducting magnet, the absence of resistance allows a persistent current to flow indefinitely, producing a strong and stable B-zero field essential for MRI. And at the same time, the underlying physics continues to inspire new ideas that bridge quantum mechanics and medical imaging technology.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

But to create spatial encoding for imaging, we also need additional gradient fields.\n\nSo, how do we generate these gradient fields? A magnetic gradient means that the magnetic field changes linearly with position. In other words, the field strength increases or decreases in a straight-line fashion along one direction.\n\nTo achieve this, the MRI scanner uses three separate gradient coils, which produce fields we call B-X, B-Y, and B-Z. Each of these gradients corresponds to one of the three spatial directions: X, Y, and Z.\n\nIf you look at the illustration, you can see how the coils are wound differently to produce different kinds of gradients. The middle portion of each field—the region near the center of the magnet—is approximately linear. That’s the part we actually use during imaging. Outside the center, the field is not perfectly linear, but that’s okay, because we only rely on this central, uniform region for accurate encoding.\n\nBy wiring the coils in specific patterns, we can make the magnetic field vary linearly along any chosen direction. So, for example, one coil arrangement gives you a gradient along the Z direction, another gives a gradient along Y, and another along X.\n\nWe don’t need to go deep into Maxwell’s equations here—that would require advanced electromagnetic theory. For now, it’s enough to have a heuristic understanding: when we wind the coils in a certain configuration, the resulting magnetic field changes linearly in space, and that’s exactly what we need to distinguish signals from different locations inside the body.\n\nSo, remember — the B-zero field provides the uniform background alignment, and the gradient coils introduce controlled, linear variations along X, Y, and Z, which allow the MRI system to encode spatial information for image reconstruction.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The basic idea is actually very simple, and this diagram illustrates it nicely.\n\nYou might remember from high school physics that whenever an electric current flows through a wire, it produces a magnetic field that circles around the wire. If we take that wire and bend it into a loop, the small circular magnetic fields from each segment combine together. The result is a field that looks like the one produced by a tiny bar magnet, pointing in the direction given by the right-hand rule — curl your fingers along the current, and your thumb points toward the magnetic field direction.\n\nNow, if you use a single loop, the magnetic field strength is small. But if you wind many loops together — for example, a coil with a hundred turns — the magnetic field becomes roughly a hundred times stronger. That’s the basic principle behind electromagnets and, in our case, gradient coils.\nOn the left side of the figure, you see a loop with current flowing upward, generating a magnetic field that points to the right. On the right side, the current direction is reversed, producing a magnetic field that points to the left.\n\nWhen we place these two coils symmetrically and run equal but opposite currents, something interesting happens. At the center between the coils, the magnetic fields cancel each other out, giving a field strength near zero. But if you move slightly to one side, one field becomes stronger while the other becomes weaker. That means the magnetic field increases linearly as you move away from the center — exactly the gradient we need.\nSo, in the central region, the total field varies in a nearly linear fashion, even though the actual fields from each coil are curved. This linear section is the useful part of the gradient field for imaging.\n\nIn summary:\u000bA single loop of current generates a circular magnetic field.\u000bMultiple loops amplify the field strength.\u000bTwo symmetric, oppositely oriented coils produce a linear gradient in the central region.\nThat’s the simple physical idea behind how gradient coils work — elegant, practical, and directly derived from the basic laws of electromagnetism you learned in school.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The linear field that we just discussed is formed between two opposing magnetic fields created by the left and right coil pairs. That configuration generates the Z-gradient field.\n\nHowever, for the X and Y gradients, we can’t arrange the coils in the same way—because the patient needs to pass through the tunnel of the magnet. So, the coil design must be adjusted while keeping the same physical principle.\n\nFor the Y-gradient, the setup uses a top coil and a bottom coil. Each coil forms what’s called a saddle-shaped loop, but it still maintains a closed current path. The magnetic field from the top coil points downward, while the field from the bottom coil points upward. In the middle, these two fields cancel each other, creating a region of zero field. As you move upward, the downward field weakens and the upward field strengthens, forming a linear Y-gradient.\nIf we rotate this entire configuration by ninety degrees, we can generate the X-gradient using exactly the same concept.\n\nWhen all these coil systems—the X, Y, and Z gradients—are combined, we can generate any arbitrary gradient field, often represented as G-X, G-Y, and G-Z. By carefully controlling the current in each set of coils, we can produce gradients in any direction or combination needed for imaging.\nIn practice, the gradient coils are designed in multiple layers, and additional shim coils are included to fine-tune the magnetic field so it remains as linear as possible within the imaging region.\n\nAlthough the engineering details are complex, the fundamental idea is simple. Using Maxwell’s equations—just four equations that describe how electric and magnetic fields behave—we can simulate the magnetic field using finite element computation. By adjusting coil shapes, adding new loops, and fine-tuning current paths, engineers can iteratively refine the field design until it achieves excellent linearity.\nSo even though the hardware looks complicated, the underlying physics is straightforward: we excite the coils in such a way that their combined fields produce the precise gradient patterns required for MRI imaging.\n\nAnd one final point—during imaging, these gradient coils rapidly switch on and off, producing mechanical stress that makes the loud knocking sounds we hear during MRI scans.\nThat’s the practical side of how gradient coils work—both physically and acoustically.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

This field is generated by the radio-frequency coil, or R-F coil.\nThe most common type of RF coil used for transmitting the B-one field is called a birdcage coil, shown on the left. You can understand this coil design quite intuitively. It looks like the frame of a cylindrical cage — a circular structure with evenly spaced conducting bars connected at both ends by rings.\n\nWhen an alternating current flows through these bars, it creates a rotating magnetic field inside the bore. This rotating field is the B-one field, which is applied perpendicular to the main magnetic field B-zero. The B-one field is responsible for exciting the protons and flipping the magnetization vector, M, away from its alignment with B-zero.\n\nOn the right side of the slide, you can see other kinds of RF coils as well. The surface coil, shown in the middle, is used for imaging regions close to the surface of the body — for example, the shoulder or knee. Because it’s placed near the area of interest, it gives excellent signal-to-noise ratio locally, though it doesn’t cover deep tissues as well.\n\nThe third design, shown on the right, is a phased-array coil. This one combines multiple small coil elements arranged in an array. Each coil picks up signals from a different region, and the signals are combined by the system to produce a high-quality image. Phased arrays are very useful for spine imaging and other applications where we need both wide coverage and high sensitivity.\n\nIn summary:\u000bThe birdcage coil is typically used for transmission — it creates a uniform B-one field, ideal for brain or whole-body imaging.\u000bThe surface coil is best for localized, high-resolution scans near the body surface.\u000bThe phased-array coil allows us to combine multiple receiver channels for stronger and faster imaging.\nSo, the RF coils are essential for both transmitting the B-one excitation field and receiving the MRI signal from the body, making them one of the most important components in the entire imaging chain.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

If you consider the two cross-sections shown here, the idea is quite intuitive. When the current in one connecting wire flows in a particular direction, it generates a local magnetic field pointing downward. To produce a local field pointing upward, the current in the adjacent wire must flow in the opposite direction, forming a closed loop.\n\nThis basic configuration—currents flowing in opposite directions through adjacent loops—creates magnetic fields that point downward in some regions and upward in others. When multiple loops or cross-sections are added around the cylinder, these individual magnetic fields combine to form a uniform field across the entire region inside the coil.\n\nMathematically, this can be shown by modulating the current as a sinusoidal function of the angular position, which we call phi. If you plot the current intensity as a function of the phi angle, it varies like a sine wave—starting from zero at phi equals zero degrees, reaching a maximum at ninety degrees, and then becoming negative at one hundred eighty degrees. This sinusoidal modulation ensures that the magnetic field intensity remains uniform across the cross-section.\n\nTo make the B-one field rotate in space, the current itself is also modulated over time, so that the maximum and minimum of the field continuously move around the coil. As a result, the B-one field rotates smoothly, allowing it to flip the magnetization vector, M, in a controlled and consistent way during excitation.\n\nIn essence, this is how we achieve a uniform rotating magnetic field that interacts with the main B-zero field. Together, the B-zero field, B-one field, and the three gradient fields—G-sub-X, G-sub-Y, and G-sub-Z—form the complete electromagnetic environment of the MRI system.\nWhat’s truly fascinating is that all of these ideas—the generation of magnetic fields, their directions, and the way they add up—can actually be explained using high school physics: Ampère’s law, the right-hand rule, and the principle of superposition.\n\nOf course, for real MRI coil design, we need precise optimization to make sure the fields are uniform and stable. That’s done through finite element analysis, a numerical technique that lets engineers compute the detailed magnetic field distribution and fine-tune the geometry of the coil.\nSo, while the physical concept is beautifully simple, the practical realization requires sophisticated computation and engineering.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

A surface coil is a smaller coil placed directly near the region of interest—for example, near the spinal cord or breast. Because it’s positioned so close to the tissue, it produces a very strong B-one field right next to the coil surface. However, the field strength drops off rapidly with distance, as you can see from the plot on the left. So the signal intensity is highest near the coil and becomes much weaker for tissues deeper inside the body.\n\nThis makes surface coils particularly useful for localized imaging, where we only need high-quality signals from a specific region, such as the spine or breast. They are also very important for parallel MRI, where multiple small coils are used together to collect data simultaneously from different parts of the body. This parallel setup helps speed up imaging and improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nIn the past, implementing parallel MRI was quite challenging because it required careful calibration and coordination among many coils to cover the entire patient. But with modern electronics and coil arrays, this technique has become highly effective and widely used.\nSo, with this slide, we’ve completed our overview of the MRI scanner hardware — the superconducting magnet for the B-zero field, the RF coils for generating and detecting the B-one field, and the gradient coils for spatial encoding along X, Y, and Z directions.\n\nUnderstanding how these fields — B-zero, B-one, and the gradient fields — work together is enough to grasp the essential physics behind MRI. Once you’re comfortable with these concepts, you’ll have a solid foundation for understanding the imaging process itself.\n\nIn the next section, we’ll shift our focus to pulse sequences — beginning with the spin echo sequence, which allows us to measure T-one-weighted, T-two-weighted, and proton-density images. Then, we’ll move on to gradient echo sequences for faster imaging, and later discuss MRI angiography, diffusion-weighted imaging, spectroscopy, and MRI contrast agents, along with their safety considerations.\n\nThis marks the transition from the hardware foundation of MRI to the signal manipulation and image formation techniques that make this technology so powerful.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Essentially, MRI operates in what we call a Fourier imaging mode, so understanding the Fourier transform is absolutely critical to understanding how images are formed.\nThis slide is really the key to everything that follows. If you can grasp what’s happening here, all the other pulse sequences — no matter how complicated they look — will make much more sense.\n\nIn the stationary reference frame, the overall signal that we detect — or equivalently, the magnetization vector M — is proportional to the proton density, written as rho of x, y. This function describes how many protons exist at each point in a given slice.\n\nWhen we apply phase encoding and frequency encoding gradients, we introduce exponential phase factors into the signal. Mathematically, this means we multiply the signal by e to the power of negative j times gamma times G-x times x times t, and also by e to the power of negative j times gamma times G-y times y times tau pe, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, G-x and G-y are the gradient field strengths, and t and tau pe are the times for which those gradients are applied.\n\nThese exponential terms introduce both phase and frequency variations across the image slice. The phase encoding adds a phase shift that depends on position in the Y direction, and the frequency encoding controls how the signal oscillates in time for each X position.\n\nTogether, these variations give each location — each small voxel — a unique combination of frequency and phase. That’s what allows us to reconstruct a tomographic image. Without this encoding, all the information from the slice would be averaged together, and we’d lose spatial detail.\n\nNow, by performing a few mathematical steps — specifically dividing and multiplying by two pi — we can rewrite these expressions in a form that matches the Fourier transform. We define two variables: k-x equals gamma times G-x times t divided by two pi, and k-y equals gamma times G-y times tau pe divided by two pi.\n\nUsing these definitions, the detected signal S of k-x, k-y becomes proportional to the double integral of rho of x, y times e to the power of negative j two pi times (k-x times x plus k-y times y) integrated over x and y. This is exactly the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the object function, rho of x, y.\nSo, the measured data that we collect in MRI — what we call k-space — is simply the Fourier transform of the spatial proton density. Once we’ve filled k-space by varying the gradient fields, we apply an inverse Fourier transform to reconstruct the image in real space.\n\nNow, in practice, the process can go in either order — you can perform phase encoding first, followed by frequency encoding, or vice versa. For each phase-encoding step, we record one line of data in k-space, and by repeating this process many times, we gradually fill the entire k-space grid.\nThe green trajectory shown on the slide illustrates how we move through k-space: phase encoding determines the starting position, and frequency encoding defines the direction in which data are collected. Different pulse sequences change the way we traverse k-space — sometimes line by line, sometimes in spirals or zigzags — but the underlying principle is always the same.\n\nFinally, because of symmetry, if the image function is purely real, we theoretically need to sample only half of k-space. However, in practice, we usually sample the full space to ensure higher accuracy and image stability.\n\nSo, to summarize: phase encoding and frequency encoding translate spatial information into distinct frequency and phase variations. The signals we collect form the Fourier representation of the object in k-space. By applying the inverse Fourier transform, we convert this frequency-domain data back into a real, tomographic image.\nThis is the essence of the k-space theorem, and it’s the mathematical foundation of nearly all MRI imaging methods.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Immediately after this, the spins start to dephase because of local field inhomogeneities — some spins precess a bit faster, others a bit slower. As a result, the transverse magnetization gradually fades away.\n\nTo correct this dephasing, a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse is applied halfway through the time interval known as T E, or echo time. This pulse effectively flips all the spins — the ones that were ahead now fall behind, and those that were behind move ahead. After an equal amount of time, all the spins come back into phase, and an echo signal is formed. That’s why we call it a spin echo — the system “rephases” itself to produce a measurable signal.\nThe T R, or repetition time, is the total time between successive ninety-degree pulses. By changing T E and T R, we can emphasize different types of image contrast — for example, T-one weighting, T-two weighting, or proton-density weighting.\n\nNow, if you look at the lower part of the diagram, you’ll see three gradient waveforms:\u000bG - slice selects the imaging slice,\u000bG - phase applies a brief pulse to encode phase differences along the Y direction, and\u000bG - freq, or the frequency-encoding gradient, is turned on during the echo readout to separate spatial information along the X direction.\n\nThe signal is then digitized by the A/D converter, forming one line of data in k-space. By repeating the process with different phase-encoding gradients, we fill up all the lines of k-space. After that, an inverse Fourier transform converts the data into the final image.\n\nSo, in summary: the spin-echo sequence uses a ninety-degree pulse to excite the spins, a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse to rephase them, and a carefully timed set of gradients to encode spatial information in both frequency and phase. This sequence forms the foundation of most MRI imaging techniques, and every other sequence — including gradient echo, echo planar, and spiral imaging — can be understood as a variation of this same principle.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

This is achieved by manipulating the resonance frequency of spins within a narrow slice using a gradient field. When we apply the gradient, the magnetic field strength changes linearly along the gradient direction. As a result, spins in different positions experience slightly different Larmor frequencies.\n\nBy sending in a radio-frequency pulse that matches the frequency range of one specific slice, we can flip the magnetization vector, M, only within that selected slice. The rest of the body remains unaffected.\n\nHowever, because the field varies linearly across the slice, the spins acquire different phase shifts — spins in regions of stronger field accumulate larger phase factors, and those in weaker fields accumulate smaller ones. This variation is called dephasing.\n\nTo correct for this, we apply a refocusing, or rephasing pulse, that has the opposite polarity. This pulse restores the overall phase coherence. It doesn’t bring every spin perfectly back to its original state but rephases them on average, so that the net signal becomes measurable again.\nIn the context of slice selection, we call this process defocusing and refocusing. The refocusing gradient usually has half the area of the initial defocusing gradient because we only need to correct the average phase dispersion, not the exact microscopic alignment.\n\nA similar process occurs during frequency encoding. When the frequency-encoding gradient is applied, it introduces another phase variation. To recover the maximum signal strength, a negative gradient pulse with half the area of the first one is applied to refocus the spins again. Although the polarity of the gradient may appear the same in diagrams, the one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse inverts the spin directions, effectively flipping the polarity of the phase, so that the final echo appears consistent in direction.\n\nThe phase-encoding gradient then introduces controlled phase shifts across the slice, allowing each spatial location to contribute a unique signal component. These differences are what allow us to reconstruct distinct pixel values in the final image.\n\nIn the spin-echo sequence, the two key timing parameters are the echo time, T-E, and the repetition time, T-R. By carefully adjusting these parameters, we can control image contrast — and, importantly, the time between echoes can also be used for additional slice selection.\n\nThat’s how we can acquire multiple slices within a single T-R period, as you see in the example here. Each slice is excited and read out in sequence using its own frequency offset, labeled as omega-one, omega-two, omega-three, and so on. This is called multi-slice imaging.\nIt’s a highly efficient way to cover a larger region of the body without increasing the total scan time.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

For example, we can excite slice three, then slice four, and then slice two, alternating the order to maximize time efficiency. This alternating strategy helps reduce the blurring or cross-talk that can occur when slices are too close together in time or space. By allowing enough separation between successive excitations, we achieve cleaner and more distinct images.\n\nNow, the spin-echo sequence we just discussed provides an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, because it effectively cancels out the dephasing caused by T-two-star effects. This gives us a pure T-two-weighted signal that’s highly reliable for tissue contrast. However, the main drawback is that the spin-echo sequence takes a long time. A full imaging session can easily last half an hour or more, which is often too slow for many clinical applications.\n\nTo address this limitation, we use gradient-echo imaging as an alternative. In a gradient-echo sequence, there is no one-hundred-eighty-degree refocusing pulse. This omission greatly shortens both the echo time, or T-E, and the repetition time, T-R. Because there’s no refocusing pulse, gradient-echo imaging does not compensate for magnetic field inhomogeneities, so the signal decays more quickly according to T-two-star relaxation rather than pure T-two.\nTo keep the signal strong and the scan fast, the echo time — T-E — is kept as short as possible, typically just a few milliseconds. In addition, the flip angle of the radio-frequency pulse is reduced to a small value, usually well below ninety degrees. This allows for rapid repetition of pulses and enables much faster imaging — often completing a full scan in less than a minute.\n\nThere are several variations of gradient-echo sequences, including: FLASH, which stands for Fast Low-Angle Shot; FISP, or Fast Imaging with Steady Precession; GRASS, which uses Gradient-Refocused Acquisition in the Steady State; and SSFP, or Steady-State Free Precession. Each of these methods is built on the same principle: using small flip angles and gradient rephasing instead of a 180-degree pulse to achieve high-speed imaging.\n\nFor any given repetition time, T-R, there exists an optimal flip angle that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio. This is known as the Ernst angle, given by the formula: alpha Ernst equals cosine inverse of e to the power of negative T-R divided by T-one. By choosing the Ernst angle, we balance image contrast and signal strength for efficient imaging.\n\nSo, to summarize: spin echo sequences give you excellent image quality but require long scan times, gradient echo sacrifices some signal stability for dramatically faster acquisition, and together, these two techniques form the foundation of nearly all MRI pulse sequences used in practice today.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

In this method, we extend the basic idea of gradient echo imaging into three spatial dimensions by using two separate phase-encoding gradients and one frequency-encoding gradient. Here’s how it works: we begin with a radio-frequency pulse that flips the magnetization vector, M, by a small angle alpha, much less than ninety degrees. Then, the system applies the first phase-encoding gradient, labeled G phase one, followed by a frequency-encoding gradient, labeled G freq, and finally a second phase-encoding gradient, G phase two. This sequence allows us to encode spatial information along all three axes — x, y, and z — so the final data form a three-dimensional Fourier transform. Mathematically, the reconstructed signal can be expressed as a triple integral over kx, ky, and kz, that is, rho of x, y, z equals the integral of S of kx, ky, kz times e to the power of j two pi times (kx x plus ky y plus kz z), integrated over dkx, dky, and dkz.\n\nEach phase-encoding step changes the gradient strength slightly, producing a different k-space plane. When we collect all these planes and perform a three-dimensional inverse Fourier transform, we obtain a volumetric image of the scanned region. Because the signal is read out immediately after excitation, it decays rather quickly due to T-two-star relaxation. However, this approach allows for very rapid data acquisition, enabling high-resolution three-dimensional imaging in a relatively short time. Compared with spin-echo sequences, the signal-to-noise ratio is somewhat lower because gradient echo does not compensate for field inhomogeneities. But the speed advantage is substantial — scans can be completed much faster.\n\nTo achieve this balance, we use a small flip angle rather than a large one. If the flip angle is too large, the magnetization along the z-axis doesn’t have enough time to recover before the next excitation, and the signal from subsequent repetitions becomes weaker. By using a smaller flip angle and a short repetition time, or T-R, we can repeatedly excite and read out signals quickly, maintaining good image quality while minimizing scan duration. In short, three-dimensional gradient echo imaging sacrifices a bit of signal strength for a dramatic improvement in imaging speed. It is particularly useful for volumetric scans of the brain, heart, and other organs where time is critical.\n\nAnd if we push the concept even further, we arrive at echo planar imaging, which can acquire an entire image — or even a full volume — in just one or a few rapid readouts. Echo planar imaging is the foundation for real-time MRI and functional MRI studies, where both speed and temporal resolution are essential.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

In this sequence, the magnetization vector, M, is first flipped into the x–y plane using a ninety-degree radio-frequency pulse. Next, slice selection is performed to isolate a specific plane — for example, the x–y plane of the imaging region. Once the slice is selected, the imaging process begins with a combination of phase encoding and frequency encoding that alternate in an oscillating pattern. This means that the frequency-encoding gradient repeatedly switches direction — first positive, then negative, then positive again — while data are continuously acquired.\n\nAs a result, the signal alternates between positive and negative readouts, forming a continuous train of echoes. Each echo corresponds to one horizontal line in k-space, and the entire pattern forms a zig-zag trajectory across k-space, as shown on the right side of the slide. Let’s interpret this step by step: slice selection determines the imaging plane, typically the x–y plane. Phase encoding moves the position in k-space vertically — that is, along the k-y direction — shifting the data line by line. Frequency encoding determines the horizontal readout, or the k-x direction, as the data are collected. Each line of k-space is traversed in alternating directions: the first line moves from left to right, the next line from right to left, and so on. This continuous acquisition pattern allows us to collect a full image, or at least a major portion of it, in a single shot.\n\nHowever, as data acquisition progresses, the signal amplitude gradually decreases due to T-two-star decay, which limits how long useful data can be collected. Because of this decay, echo planar imaging may sometimes cover only part of k-space during one acquisition, requiring multiple passes to fill in the remaining data. Even with that limitation, EPI is dramatically faster than conventional three-dimensional gradient-echo imaging. In fact, it can complete a full image in just a fraction of a second. That’s why echo planar imaging has become the foundation for real-time MRI and functional MRI, where rapid temporal sampling is more important than perfect image contrast.\n\nAnd when we want to go even faster, we can move beyond echo planar imaging to spiral imaging, which traces k-space in smooth circular trajectories, further reducing acquisition time.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

In spiral imaging, there is no separate phase encoding step. Instead, both gradient fields — G x and G y — continuously change their amplitudes over time. The relative strength of these two gradients determines the instantaneous slope of the trajectory in k-space.\n\nAt the very beginning, the system starts from the origin of k-space, meaning the initial point of the phase vector is zero. As time progresses, the amplitudes of G x and G y vary smoothly, causing the trajectory to move outward in a spiral pattern. The direction of this spiral is controlled by the relative phase and amplitude ratio between the two gradients. Initially, the trajectory moves along a specific direction for a short distance. Then, as the relative gradient amplitudes change, the slope and direction of the path gradually rotate. This continuous change allows the k-space trajectory to trace a smooth spiral curve, expanding outward from the center as higher spatial frequencies are collected.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that it provides continuous control over both gradients, allowing highly efficient coverage of k-space. Depending on the design, the spiral can move from the center outward, from the periphery inward, or even use multiple interleaved spirals that fill k-space more densely and reduce artifacts. Because of this flexibility, spiral imaging offers excellent speed while still maintaining high spatial resolution. It captures low-frequency components first — which contain the overall image contrast — and then gradually collects higher-frequency components that define fine structural detail.\nAfter data acquisition, the spiral k-space data must be interpolated onto a rectangular grid before applying the two-dimensional inverse Fourier transform to reconstruct the image. This reconstruction yields T-one-weighted, T-two-weighted, or proton-density-weighted images, depending on how the pulse sequence parameters — such as flip angle, T-E, and T-R — are chosen. Understanding how data are collected in k-space is crucial. If you fully grasp how the gradients define the k-space trajectory — whether linear, zigzag, or spiral — the entire process of MRI image formation becomes intuitive. Otherwise, it can seem abstract or confusing.\n\nFinally, these flexible gradient-based trajectories also open the door to specialized MRI pulse sequences. For example, in MR angiography, we can tailor the sequence to highlight blood flow, just as CT angiography does for X-ray-based imaging. By manipulating the gradient and timing parameters, we can emphasize vascular structures and obtain clear, high-resolution images of the circulatory system. So, spiral imaging not only accelerates acquisition but also serves as a bridge to more advanced and application-specific MRI techniques, such as angiography, diffusion imaging, and functional MRI.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

In a standard CT image, blood vessels and soft tissues often appear very similar in density. As a result, it’s difficult to distinguish the vasculature — you can’t easily tell whether a vessel is open, narrowed, or completely blocked. To solve this problem in CT, we use a contrast agent — typically iodine — a liquid metal with a very high linear attenuation coefficient. When injected into the bloodstream, iodine increases the attenuation of X-rays in the blood, making vessels appear much brighter than the surrounding soft tissue. If a vessel that should be wide suddenly appears narrow or faint in the CT image, that suggests a vascular blockage, which could require stenting or further cardiac intervention. This is the basic principle behind CT angiography.\n\nNow, for MRI angiography, the principle is different, but the goal is the same — to make the blood vessels appear distinct from the surrounding tissue. Here’s how it works: we first select a single imaging slice, and then apply a radio-frequency pulse, typically using an echo-planar imaging sequence, to flip the spins — those small magnetic dipoles — within that slice. At that instant, both the blood within the vessel and the stationary tissue generate signals that are quite similar, so initially, the vessel is not clearly visible. But if we wait a little longer, something interesting happens. The blood that was originally in the imaging slice flows out of the plane, and new blood — containing unflipped spins — flows in from outside. This is what we call the through-plane mechanism.\nBecause the newly arrived blood has not been excited by the RF pulse, it produces no signal in that moment. Meanwhile, the surrounding stationary tissue continues to emit its signal, which gradually decays but does not vanish immediately. As a result, when we collect the data after a short delay, the moving blood appears bright, while the stationary tissue looks relatively dark. This contrast difference allows us to visualize the vasculature clearly.\n\nThe Time-of-Flight effect is strongest when the blood flow is perpendicular to the imaging slice — that is, when blood moves directly through the plane of excitation. If the vessel runs within the plane of the slice, then the same spins remain in the imaging region, and the through-plane mechanism does not work effectively.\n\nSo, to summarize: in CT angiography, iodine contrast enhances X-ray attenuation. In MR angiography, the motion of blood itself provides the contrast, through the time-of-flight effect and the through-plane mechanism. This principle forms the foundation of non-contrast MR angiography, allowing clear visualization of blood flow without any injected contrast agents.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Unlike the time-of-flight technique that works mainly through the through-plane mechanism, phase-contrast imaging is an in-plane mechanism — meaning it can detect blood flow in any direction, not just perpendicular to the slice. The basic idea is similar to what we’ve seen in echo-planar imaging. We start with an alpha pulse that flips the magnetization vector, M, by an angle alpha for slice selection. All the spins within the selected slice then work together to produce a coherent signal. As usual, frequency encoding and phase encoding are applied to collect the Fourier information from that slice.\n\nHowever, in a normal Fourier-based MRI scan, the pixel intensities for blood and stationary tissue — in terms of T-one, T-two, or proton density — often appear very similar. This makes it difficult to distinguish flowing blood from static tissue. To separate them, we introduce a pair of bipolar gradient pulses — one positive and one negative — before data acquisition. The first, or positive, gradient pulse adds a phase shift to all spins, and the second, or negative, gradient pulse adds an equal but opposite phase shift. For stationary spins — such as those in soft tissue — these two effects cancel perfectly, leaving no net phase change.\n\nBut if the spins are moving, as in flowing blood, something different happens. Between the two gradient pulses, the blood cells physically move to a new position, so they experience slightly different local magnetic fields. As a result, the positive and negative gradients do not cancel out completely. The motion introduces an extra phase term that accumulates over time, and this additional phase is directly proportional to the velocity of the moving spins. By measuring the difference in phase between two acquisitions — one with and one without motion encoding — we can isolate the component of the signal that depends purely on blood flow. This produces a phase-contrast image, where bright regions correspond to areas of flow and darker regions to stationary tissue.\n\nIn mathematical form, this accumulated phase, phi, is given by an integral of the gradient over time: phi equals the integral from zero to tau over two of gamma times G-x times x of t, d-t, plus the integral from tau over two to tau of gamma times negative G-x times x of t, d-t. The net phase difference reflects the motion of the spins under the bipolar gradients. Conceptually, you can think of time-of-flight imaging as a passive effect, where the signal difference arises simply because new, unflipped blood enters the slice. In contrast, phase-contrast imaging is an active mechanism, where we intentionally encode blood motion into the phase of the signal.\n\nAnd unlike X-ray phase-contrast imaging — which measures refractive index variations — MRI phase-contrast imaging detects the phase shift of the magnetic vector caused by moving spins. It doesn’t matter whether the blood flows up, down, or sideways — as long as the spins move through regions with slightly different magnetic fields, the phase difference can be detected and visualized. By exploiting these motion-induced phase shifts, we can generate clear vascular images and even quantify blood velocity or flow rate. Together with time-of-flight imaging, phase-contrast imaging provides a complete toolkit for visualizing the circulatory system without the need for injected contrast agents.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Remember, our body is made up mostly of water, and these water molecules are constantly moving around. This motion — or diffusion — becomes physiologically and pathologically important, especially when something goes wrong at the cellular level. For example, when a cell membrane becomes swollen or damaged, water can leak out of the cell, altering the normal diffusion and perfusion patterns in that tissue. That’s why studying how water moves can tell us a lot about what’s happening inside the body — particularly in the brain — in cases like stroke, tumor, or inflammation.\n\nNow, conceptually, diffusion-weighted imaging is similar to angiography imaging, because both deal with motion — but in DWI, we’re focusing on the microscopic motion of water molecules rather than blood flow. The pulse sequence looks a little different, but the underlying idea remains very similar. Here, we use a spin-echo sequence with a 90-degree excitation pulse followed by a 180-degree refocusing pulse. You’ll notice two gradient pulses, placed symmetrically on both sides of the 180-degree pulse — these are called diffusion-sensitizing gradients.\n\nWe already know that a 180-degree pulse flips the magnetization vector upside down. So, from the perspective of the first gradient pulse, the second one has the opposite polarity. If nothing in the tissue is moving — meaning the water molecules are stationary — then whatever phase shift is induced by the first gradient will be perfectly canceled out by the second one. In that case, there is no net signal change. But if the water molecules move between the two gradient pulses — for example, diffusing from one position to another — they experience slightly different magnetic field strengths at those two locations. As a result, the phase shifts from the two gradients no longer cancel out perfectly. This causes a measurable signal loss, which tells us that motion or diffusion has occurred.\n\nThe signal attenuation due to diffusion depends on three main factors: first, the gradient strength, represented by capital G; second, the duration of each gradient pulse, denoted by the Greek letter delta; and third, the time separation between the two gradients, represented by capital Delta. Together, these parameters determine how sensitive the sequence is to molecular motion. The diffusion-related signal intensity can be expressed as I of G n equals I zero times e to the power of negative D gamma squared G n squared delta squared times (Delta minus delta over three). This equation shows how the measured signal decreases with stronger diffusion.\n\nPractically, we don’t need to go through the derivation — the key takeaway is that diffusion efficiency can be quantified and used as a diagnostic marker. In a typical spin-echo sequence, the gradients can be applied along the x, y, or z direction, depending on which axis of diffusion we want to measure. For example, diffusion in the through-plane direction — perpendicular to the imaging slice — can reveal how water molecules move between layers of tissue. When diffusion appears unusually high, it may indicate disrupted or damaged cellular structure, such as in ischemic tissue. So, by analyzing diffusion in this way, we gain valuable insight into both normal physiology and pathological conditions.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

It varies from place to place — and more importantly, it also depends on direction. If you measure diffusion along one direction, you’ll get a certain value. Measure it along another direction, and you’ll likely get a different one. And along yet another direction, it changes again. So, unlike uniform motion that can be described by a simple vector — where the magnitude represents the speed and the direction shows the path — here, the diffusion rate itself depends on orientation. To describe such directional dependence, we need a more general concept than a vector — and that’s where the tensor comes in.\n\nMathematically, we call this the diffusion tensor, often denoted by capital D. It’s a three-by-three symmetric matrix that characterizes how diffusion behaves along different spatial directions. Each element of this matrix describes the relationship between diffusion along one axis and its coupling with another axis — for example, D one one, D one two, D one three, and so on. This means the diffusion process is anisotropic, or directionally dependent. In biological tissues such as white matter in the brain, water molecules tend to diffuse more easily along the fibers than across them, because the cell membranes and myelin sheaths restrict motion in the perpendicular directions. Similarly, in vasculature, blood and water tend to follow the principal axes of the vessels.\n\nNow, if we extend this idea further, we can describe the random diffusion process mathematically. The probability that a molecule starting at position r-naught moves to position r after some diffusion time, tau, can be expressed using a multivariate Gaussian function. This is written as: p of r given r-naught and tau equals one over (4 pi tau) to the power three-halves times the square root of the determinant of D, multiplied by e to the power of negative (1 over 4 tau) times (r minus r-naught) transpose, times D inverse, times (r minus r-naught). In simpler terms, this function describes the probability distribution of molecular displacement — how far and in what direction the molecules are likely to move during diffusion.\n\nSo, diffusion tensor imaging, or DTI, is the MRI technique that measures this tensor for every voxel in the image. It gives us a complete three-dimensional map of how water diffuses in tissue — allowing us to infer the orientation of fibers and structural connectivity in the brain and other organs.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

So, at each location in the image, the color tells us the dominant direction of diffusion, and the brightness shows the degree of anisotropy, or how directional the diffusion is.\n\nFor example, a bright red region indicates that diffusion is strongest along the x-direction, green shows diffusion along y, and blue along z. When these combine, you get intermediate colors—just like mixing red, green, and blue light—forming a vivid, color-coded diffusion map.\nThis type of image is called a fractional anisotropy, or FA map.\n\u000bIt tells us how strongly the diffusion is confined to one particular direction. In regions such as the white matter of the brain, where axonal fibers are highly aligned, the diffusion is strongly anisotropic—so these areas appear bright and vividly colored.\nWhat makes this especially powerful is that we are not only seeing the brain’s anatomy, but also its function and connectivity.\u000bWhile CT imaging primarily gives us anatomical information—showing structures, shapes, and densities—MRI can provide functional information, such as how water and blood move inside tissues.\n\nUsing diffusion-weighted and diffusion-tensor imaging, we can track how water molecules travel along nerve fibers, revealing the brain’s communication pathways. This is one of the reasons MRI is considered both a structural and a functional imaging modality.\nAnd with that understanding of diffusion and perfusion imaging, we are ready to move to the final concept of this section—spectral imaging, which explores the frequency domain information contained in MRI signals.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

You can think of it as extending the same Fourier-based idea we’ve been discussing — but now, instead of looking at a single signal per voxel, we analyze multiple frequencies coming from that same voxel. Let’s pay attention to the sentence highlighted here: each voxel emits signals at multiple frequencies, rather than just a single frequency.\n\nIn conventional MRI, after phase and frequency encoding, every pixel or voxel produces one main signal — one frequency — corresponding to its local environment. But in spectral imaging, or what we often call MR spectroscopy, that same voxel emits several frequencies at once. Why does this happen? Because not all water molecules are in the same chemical environment. Some are bound within proteins, some interact with lipids, and others are part of metabolites. Each of these environments slightly shifts the resonance frequency of the hydrogen nuclei — what we call a chemical shift.\n\nAs a result, a single voxel gives rise to multiple peaks — each corresponding to different chemical compounds. For example, in the spectrum shown here, you can see peaks for creatine, choline, glutamate, glutamine, and N-acetylaspartate, or NAA. These molecules tell us about the brain’s biochemical composition — for instance, NAA is a marker of healthy neurons, while choline indicates cell membrane turnover. So, spectral imaging gives us access to biochemical information, not just structural or functional detail. By measuring the exact frequencies and amplitudes of these peaks, we can infer what molecules are present and in what quantities.\n\nThe next natural question is — how do we obtain these signals from a specific pixel or voxel? There are two main approaches, just like the passive and active methods we discussed earlier in angiography. Both techniques let us excite or isolate specific regions in space to record their unique spectral signatures — and we’ll explore those next.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

This method is commonly used to acquire the MR spectrum from a single voxel — that is, a small three-dimensional volume within the body. Here’s the idea: you begin by applying a 90-degree RF pulse to select a specific slice of tissue, as shown in the figure. Then, you apply two 180-degree pulses, each combined with a gradient field — one along the x direction and another along the y direction. These three pulses — one 90-degree and two 180-degree — together define a small box-shaped region in space.\n\nOnly the nuclei located inside that box experience all three RF pulses, and therefore, only that region contributes to the detected MR signal. Everything outside that voxel is effectively suppressed. Once the voxel is defined, the signal collected from it contains contributions from all the chemical compounds present there — for example, metabolites like creatine, choline, and N-acetylaspartate. When you perform a Fourier transform on that signal, you get a spectrum, which shows the characteristic peaks of these molecules.\n\nSo essentially, PRESS isolates a specific voxel in three dimensions using three orthogonal gradients — Gx, Gy, and Gz — and extracts its spectrum. The next method, called chemical shift imaging, extends this idea further. It’s a bit more complex but very powerful. Instead of acquiring data from just one voxel, it gathers spectral information from multiple voxels across a slice — creating a spatially resolved chemical map. This is a more advanced, and often more time-consuming, approach, but conceptually, it builds directly on what you see here.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

This method extends the idea of PRESS. Instead of selecting a single voxel, CSI allows us to collect spectra from multiple voxels simultaneously, across an entire slice. Here’s how it works. First, you select an axial slice in the z-direction using a 90-degree RF pulse combined with a slice-selection gradient, as shown in the figure. Then, phase encoding is applied in the x and y directions — that’s what the Gx and Gy gradients represent here.\n\nAs a result, the MRI system collects signals from many small voxels arranged in a grid pattern, as you can see on the right. Each voxel now contains its own chemical spectrum, showing peaks from various metabolites, just like the one we saw in PRESS. To reconstruct this data, we perform two-dimensional inverse Fourier transformations with respect to the spatial dimensions x and y, and a forward Fourier transformation with respect to time. This process gives a full spectrum for each voxel, mapping both spatial and chemical information across the slice.\n\nIn simpler terms, PRESS gives you the spectrum from one small volume, while CSI gives you a whole map of spectra from many volumes at once. It’s computationally heavier and takes longer to acquire, but it provides much richer biochemical information throughout the tissue. This technique is particularly valuable in brain spectroscopy, where you can visualize metabolic differences between normal and abnormal tissues. And just like other MRI techniques, the image quality and contrast can be further improved using specialized contrast agents — typically compounds based on magnetic elements with unpaired electrons, which help enhance local magnetic field effects and improve visibility.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

MRI contrast agents are usually paramagnetic materials, meaning they have unpaired electrons that create local magnetic field variations. These variations enhance the local signal intensity and improve the signal-to-noise ratio, allowing us to better differentiate between tissues. When a contrast agent is introduced into the body, it tends to accumulate in regions with rich vasculature, such as tumors. This makes those areas appear brighter in the MRI image, helping radiologists identify abnormal growths or tissue changes.\n\nThe most common class of MRI contrast agents is based on metal ions such as gadolinium, manganese, or europium. Among these, gadolinium is particularly effective because the ion Gd³⁺ has seven unpaired electrons — the maximum possible — which gives it a very strong magnetic moment. However, gadolinium by itself is toxic, so it cannot be injected directly. Instead, it is safely enclosed in a chemical cage, called a chelate, that binds the gadolinium tightly. One of the most widely used formulations is Gadolinium DTPA, or Gadolinium Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic Acid, which is marketed under the trade name Magnevist.\n\nThis compound has been used clinically for many years to enhance MRI scans of the brain, spine, and other organs. It works by creating small magnetic inhomogeneities that shorten relaxation times, giving a strong contrast enhancement in vascular and pathological regions. However, although MRI itself is considered a green and non-ionizing imaging technique — unlike CT, which involves radiation — recent studies have shown that these contrast agents are not entirely harmless. Traces of gadolinium can sometimes remain in the body, leading to concerns about long-term safety, especially for patients who undergo repeated contrast-enhanced MRI scans.\n\nSo while MRI remains fundamentally safe, it’s important to be aware of potential risks associated with certain contrast materials, and to continue developing safer, more biocompatible alternatives for the future.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

On the left is the chemical structure of Gd-DTPA. In this molecule, the gadolinium ion — which has seven unpaired electrons — is enclosed within a stable chelating cage. This cage prevents the toxic metal from freely interacting with biological tissue, while still allowing it to influence nearby water molecules. When water molecules come close to the contrast agent, they experience local magnetic field changes that speed up their T₁ relaxation, producing a brighter signal on the MRI image. Water molecules that directly interact with the free binding site of the gadolinium ion experience what we call inner-sphere relaxation, resulting in a strong signal increase. Those that are nearby but not directly bound experience outer-sphere relaxation, which is weaker but still noticeable.\n\nOn the right, you can see a brain MRI taken after administration of Gd-DTPA. Notice the bright region within the brain — this enhancement clearly reveals a tumor. The contrast agent has accumulated in that region because tumors typically have leaky vasculature, allowing the agent to diffuse more freely into the tissue. However, it’s important to mention that these contrast agents are not entirely safe. Although gadolinium is held within a chemical cage, studies have shown that residual traces of gadolinium can remain in the human body — particularly in the brain and kidneys — for a long time after injection. This has raised significant safety concerns.\n\nAs a result, the European Union has restricted or prohibited the clinical use of several popular gadolinium-based contrast agents. Researchers and manufacturers are now working to design safer alternatives — either agents that can be excreted more efficiently or new imaging methods that require little or no contrast agent at all.

Gadolinium, symbol Gd, is one of the 17 rare-earth elements and belongs to the lanthanide series of metals. It’s a paramagnetic material, meaning it has unpaired electrons that interact with magnetic fields. This property makes gadolinium extremely useful for enhancing the contrast in MRI scans, helping us visualize blood flow, tissue abnormalities, and tumors more clearly.\n\nHowever, gadolinium itself is highly toxic to humans. It has no natural biological role and is not found anywhere in the human body under normal conditions. The problem arises because gadolinium ions are similar in size and charge to calcium ions, which are essential for many cellular processes. When free gadolinium ions enter the body, they can interfere with calcium-dependent mechanisms, disrupting normal cell function. To minimize this risk, gadolinium is used in a chelated form, meaning it is locked inside a chemical cage — such as DTPA — to prevent the toxic metal from interacting directly with tissues.\n\nHowever, studies have shown that not all of the gadolinium is completely excreted from the body after an MRI. Small amounts can remain in the brain, kidneys, and other organs, even months or years later. This residual gadolinium may lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, neurological effects, or even genetic damage at the cellular level. Over the past decade, these concerns have prompted major regulatory changes. The European Medicines Agency has restricted or banned the clinical use of several widely used gadolinium-based contrast agents, particularly those that release gadolinium more easily.\n\nSo, while MRI itself is a non-ionizing and generally safe imaging modality, the contrast agents we use must be handled with caution.

Research in recent years has revealed that gadolinium-based agents — while extremely useful for improving image clarity — can sometimes remain in the body long after the scan, particularly in the brain and even within bone tissue. In response to this growing concern, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, launched an extensive investigation. In 2017, their committee reviewed evidence showing that traces of gadolinium could persist in brain tissues for many months after a single injection. MRI scans even showed increased signal intensity in regions where gadolinium had accumulated.\n\nFollowing this review, the EMA decided to take precautionary action. They suspended several widely used linear gadolinium-based contrast agents, including MultiHance, Omniscan, Magnevist, and OptiMARK. These were once very common in clinical MRI but are now restricted in Europe due to the risk of residual gadolinium retention. This is not something you’ll find discussed in most textbooks yet — it’s a relatively recent development, but an important one to know. It reminds us that while MRI is a non-ionizing and generally safe imaging technique, it still comes with chemical safety considerations when contrast agents are used.\n\nNow, from here, I’ll move quickly through a few additional slides that are not required for this course, but they’re worth knowing to give you a broader perspective.

It’s not only used to visualize anatomical structures, like the brain’s gray matter and white matter, but also to explore neurological function — how different regions of the brain communicate and interact. Researchers around the world, through major brain initiatives, are using advanced MRI techniques to map brain connectivity, monitor neural activity, and understand complex cognitive processes such as memory, decision-making, and emotion.\n\nIn this way, MRI has become one of the most important technologies for both clinical diagnosis and fundamental neuroscience research.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

The initiative brought together major agencies such as the NIH, NSF, DARPA, and later FDA and IARPA. Each agency contributes in its own way — from developing new tools and technologies, to studying cognition, rehabilitation, and neurological regulation. The research priorities include identifying brain cell types, mapping neural circuits, developing technologies to monitor brain activity, and creating precise intervention tools.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to integrate all of these approaches to achieve a comprehensive understanding of how the brain functions — from the molecular level to behavior.

Here, subjects were shown two different types of images — human faces and buildings. The MRI scans you see here show how the brain reacts differently in each case. When a person looks at a face, certain brain regions light up — you can see those areas in red and orange. When the same person looks at a building, other regions become more active. This happens because the brain’s oxygen-rich blood flow changes depending on what you are thinking or perceiving.\n\nWhen neurons in a region start firing, they consume more oxygen. The body responds by sending in oxygenated blood, which creates a stronger MRI signal in that area. This mechanism is called the BOLD effect, short for Blood Oxygen Level Dependent contrast. By analyzing these signal patterns statistically, we can tell what kind of object the person is viewing — for example, a face versus a house. This was one of the early experiments demonstrating how brain activity reflects thought and perception.\n\nIn more recent studies, researchers have gone even further. Using advanced image analysis and machine learning, they can now reconstruct, with rough resolution, what a person is actually seeing — essentially allowing us to peek into human perception. It’s an incredible step toward understanding how the brain encodes visual information.

For instance, imagine a criminal suspect claiming, “I didn’t commit the crime.” If you place this person in an MRI scanner and show images of various locations — one being the actual crime scene — the brain’s response will be noticeably different when that familiar location appears.\n\nThe brain’s recognition centers light up, revealing subconscious memory traces, even when the person tries to hide it. This shows the incredible potential of functional MRI — not just for medical diagnosis, but also for applications in neuroscience, psychology, and even criminal investigation.\nThe video runs about ten minutes, and it’s well worth watching.

For example, PET/CT and PET/MRI scanners combine anatomical and functional information together, so that we can see both the structure and the physiology in one unified image.\n\nBeyond this, people are exploring hybrid imaging ideas, where optical imaging, ultrasound, or even photoacoustic methods are combined with MRI or CT to capture complementary information. These approaches can greatly enhance diagnostic accuracy and help us understand the body’s processes at multiple scales — from cellular activity all the way to organ-level structure.\n\nSo, while MRI itself is a powerful and mature modality, the fusion of imaging technologies is opening up new horizons — what we might call the “next generation” of biomedical imaging systems.

In cardiac imaging, for example, CT clearly shows the coronary vasculature and calcifications, while MRI reveals the soft tissue and functional aspects of the heart.

However, with a polarized radio tracer, the emission becomes directionally dependent. That means the gamma rays are no longer isotropic — they are preferentially emitted along specific directions.\n\nAs shown in the figure, when nuclei are fully polarized along a magnetic field, the emitted gamma rays have a strong preference for the horizontal direction, and almost none are emitted vertically. By using RF pulses and magnetic field manipulations, similar to those in MRI, we can flip this polarization vector — sometimes called the M vector — to control the emission direction.\n\nIn other words, by flipping the spins with an RF pulse, we can switch from collecting gamma rays along the x–y plane to collecting them along the z direction. This enables us to encode spatial information into the atomic spin orientation, essentially merging nuclear imaging and magnetic resonance mechanisms.\nThe result is that polarized nuclear imaging provides much higher sensitivity than conventional MRI, since the signal is derived directly from gamma emission rather than from weak magnetic resonance. The only drawback is that it does not account for attenuation, which is usually handled by CT.\n\nOur recent paper builds on this idea — showing that by using a polarized tracer, we can reconstruct both the radioactive tracer concentration and the attenuation background simultaneously, combining what MRI and CT each do best into a single integrated framework.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

Unfortunately, none of these isotopes fit that range — they are either too long or too short.\nThat’s why our team has been collaborating with chemists and nuclear physicists to identify or synthesize new polarizable tracers with more suitable half-lives and emission properties.\n\u000bIf such tracers can be developed, they would make simultaneous emission–transmission tomography a realistic and powerful imaging tool for the future.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

As I mentioned earlier, each polarized tracer behaves like a tiny donut that can be flipped in any direction. If the polarization is not aligned with the detector, you won’t detect any signal. But once you flip it to the right orientation, that voxel — or pixel — becomes active, and we can measure it. In this model, for each voxel we have two unknowns: the local attenuation coefficient, which we call “mu of r,” and the local tracer concentration, which we call “lambda of r.”\n\nTo estimate these two unknowns, we make two measurements — one from the left and one from the right — denoted as “m one of r” and “m two of r.” These two measurements are expressed as: m one of r equals phi of r times the exponential of negative integral from minus infinity to r of mu of r d r, and m two of r equals phi of r times the exponential of negative integral from r to infinity of mu of r d r. Here, phi of r represents the gamma-ray flux, and mu of r is the attenuation coefficient along the ray path.\n\nIf we take the logarithm of the ratio “m one of r over m two of r,” we obtain an expression involving the difference of two integrals of mu. By differentiating this relationship, we can recover mu of r directly as negative one-half times the derivative with respect to r of the logarithm of “m one over m two.” Once mu of r is known, we can calculate phi of r, which equals the exponential of the integral of mu of r times m one of r, or equivalently, the exponential of the integral of mu of r times m two of r, depending on direction.\n\nIn simple terms, this means the gamma flux escaping from each side of an activated voxel is proportional to the tracer concentration at that point. So, with just two directional measurements per voxel, we can reconstruct both the attenuation coefficient and the tracer concentration — achieving simultaneous emission and transmission tomography in a single scan. That’s the key idea behind SET, or Simultaneous Emission–Transmission Tomography.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

When we use a polarized radio tracer, we can perform both emission and transmission tomography within the same MRI framework. Because the tracer is polarized, it can emit gamma rays directionally — and since the polarization can be flipped, we can measure signals from multiple directions without rotating any hardware.\n\nThis setup naturally integrates with MRI. So not only can we collect MRI signals, but at the same time, we can measure attenuation, just like in CT, and tracer concentration, as in nuclear imaging. In other words, we can combine the strengths of all three modalities — CT gives us attenuation information, MRI gives us soft-tissue and molecular contrast, and nuclear imaging provides tracer distribution — all in one coordinated system.\n\nHere, you see a concept for whole-body imaging. The patient lies inside a large cylindrical magnet, and the radio tracer inside the body is flipped periodically. Each time the tracer is flipped, gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions. These emissions are detected from both sides, allowing us to reconstruct a complete image of the entire body. A key advantage of this method is that the collimation — or the directional selection of gamma photons — is achieved magnetically. That means we no longer need a mechanical collimator, which normally blocks most photons and wastes energy.\n\nMagnetic collimation captures more of the emitted photons, improving sensitivity and reducing noise. So this design minimizes photon waste and integrates the best parts of CT, MRI, and nuclear imaging — offering a very promising pathway for future multi-modality imaging systems.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 55}

In our case, the transducer converts electrical energy into mechanical vibration to generate the ultrasound wave.

And as always, for every imaging modality we study, pay close attention to the outline — it tells you exactly what to focus on. Try to understand each of these key ideas clearly — the wave, the transducer, the resolution, and the contrast — because together, they form the foundation for everything that follows in ultrasound imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

The next one is ultrasound, and after that, we’ll finish with optical imaging, which, as you’ll see later, is also very unique and quite powerful.\n\nUltrasound imaging has several clear advantages. First, it involves no ionizing radiation. That’s very important because, unlike X-rays or gamma rays, ultrasound uses mechanical sound waves, not electromagnetic radiation. So there’s no risk of DNA damage and no concern about radiation-induced cancer.\nAnother major strength is speed. Ultrasound provides images in real time — you can literally move the probe and watch the image update instantly. The transducer, or ultrasound probe, can be gently moved across the body, for example, over the abdomen to monitor a baby during pregnancy, or over the chest to examine cardiac function. It’s a quick, flexible, and low-cost imaging modality.\n\nOf course, like every imaging method, ultrasound has its limitations. One limitation is the penetration depth. It can’t go very deep into the body, especially through hard tissue or bone. X-ray imaging, in contrast, is excellent for bone-tissue or tissue-air interfaces — like lungs or bones — because those materials have very different densities and attenuate X-rays differently. Ultrasound, on the other hand, depends on acoustic impedance, which determines how sound travels through a material. When there’s a large mismatch in impedance, such as between air and bone, most of the ultrasound energy reflects back instead of penetrating.\n\nThat’s why it’s difficult to image structures behind the lungs or skull. To get a clear image of the heart, for example, you have to find an acoustic window between the ribs — an area where sound can travel through soft tissue effectively.\n\nUltrasound imaging mainly works on the principle of reflection and scattering. The system sends out sound waves; those waves hit structures inside the body — tissue boundaries, organs, or small particles — and the echoes are detected to form an image. There are also transmission-based ultrasound methods, but those are less common in clinical imaging.\n\nBeyond diagnosis, ultrasound is used for image-guided procedures, such as biopsies and minimally invasive surgeries, where live ultrasound images can be registered with prior CT or MRI scans to help guide the doctor precisely.\n\nAnd in recent years, ultrasound has even found a role in neuromodulation — using focused ultrasound to stimulate neural tissue, potentially helping to treat conditions like depression or Parkinson’s disease. This is a very exciting and emerging field, showing that ultrasound is far more than just an imaging tool.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

It’s important to remember that ultrasound is not an electromagnetic wave. This makes it fundamentally different from X-ray, CT, nuclear imaging, or MRI.\n\nMRI, for example, uses radio-frequency (RF) signals, which are simply alternating magnetic fields — still part of the electromagnetic spectrum. X-ray and nuclear imaging use high-energy photons — X-rays and gamma rays — which can behave like both waves and particles. All of those imaging types relate to Maxwell’s equations if we describe them as waves, or to Boltzmann’s equations if we describe them as particles.\nBut ultrasound is different — it’s a mechanical wave, not electromagnetic. It physically vibrates particles in a medium — air, water, or biological tissue. That’s why it needs a medium to travel; it can’t move through a vacuum.\n\nAs you can see in this frequency chart, the audible range for humans is roughly from 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz — that’s what you and I can hear, like my speaking voice or birds singing. Ultrasound goes far beyond that, starting from around 20 kilohertz and reaching into the megahertz range.\n\nIn medical imaging, typical frequencies are between 2 MHz and 20 MHz, depending on the application. Lower frequencies penetrate deeper but give lower resolution; higher frequencies provide sharper images but can’t go as deep. Industrial and destructive-testing ultrasounds can reach up to hundreds of megahertz.\nSo, unlike the sound waves we can hear, these ultrasound waves are way too high-frequency for our ears. And with very high-power, focused ultrasound, we can actually go beyond imaging — we can cut or heat tissue, like a kind of ultrasound knife. It’s used in certain treatments to destroy tumors or cauterize tissue.\n\nBut in this lecture, our focus remains on diagnostic ultrasound imaging — understanding how these mechanical waves are formed, transmitted, and received to create medical images.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

This is Robert Boyle’s experiment, one of the earliest demonstrations of how sound needs a medium to travel.\n\nSo imagine this setup: we have a ringing alarm clock placed inside a large glass chamber with a valve on top. At first, the clock is ringing, and you can clearly hear the sound through the air inside the container. Then, we connect a vacuum pump and start to remove the air from the chamber.\n\nAs the air is pumped out, the sound of the clock becomes weaker and weaker until eventually, you can hardly hear anything at all. The clock is still ringing, but with almost no air inside the chamber, there’s nothing to carry the sound waves to your ears.\nThen, when you open the valve and let air rush back into the chamber, the sound suddenly becomes loud again.\n\nThis simple experiment beautifully demonstrates that sound waves require a medium — such as air, water, or tissue — to propagate. Unlike light or X-rays, which can travel through a vacuum, mechanical waves cannot.\n\nSo, in ultrasound imaging, the same principle applies: the sound waves travel through biological tissue, reflecting and scattering as they go, allowing us to measure and form images. Without a proper medium — say, if there’s air between the transducer and the skin — no ultrasound signal would be transmitted effectively. That’s why, as you’ll see later, we always use ultrasound gel to eliminate air gaps and ensure good acoustic coupling between the probe and the body.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

When a transducer or some vibrating source starts pushing on those molecules, it moves them back and forth along one direction — say, the z-axis.\n\nWhen the transducer pushes the molecules forward, they become compressed, and when it pulls back, they spread apart. This alternating process of compression and rarefaction creates a longitudinal wave that travels through the medium.\nIf you look carefully at the top figure, the denser areas represent compressions, where molecules are packed tightly together and pressure is high. The lighter areas show rarefactions, where the molecules are spread apart and the pressure is lower.\n\nNow, something very interesting happens here: the wave itself travels forward, but the individual molecules don’t actually move along with it. Each molecule simply vibrates back and forth around its equilibrium position — it oscillates, but it doesn’t go anywhere overall.\n\nSo, the sound wave is really a transfer of energy through the medium, not a transfer of matter. The wave moves, but the particles stay roughly where they are, just vibrating locally. That’s an essential idea to keep in mind when we talk about how ultrasound propagates through tissue — the energy travels forward, not the molecules themselves.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

This is a really fundamental question — what makes a wave a wave?\nTo understand this, we need to bring together three important physical principles.\n\u000bFirst, the conservation of mass, which tells us that mass cannot be created or destroyed — it must remain constant within the system.\u000bSecond, there’s the relationship between pressure and volume — when you squeeze something, the pressure inside changes in a predictable way.\u000bAnd third, we have Newton’s second law, which relates force to mass and acceleration.\n\nIf you imagine a perfectly rigid body, and you push on one end, the entire object moves together as one piece — there’s no wave because nothing inside deforms or compresses. But in real materials, there’s some elasticity — things can compress slightly and bounce back. That elasticity allows small disturbances to propagate as waves.\nSo, when you push on a small region, it compresses and transmits that force to its neighbors, setting off a chain reaction that moves through the medium. The result is a wave.\n\nNow, if we were talking about electromagnetic waves, such as light or X-rays, we’d describe them using Maxwell’s equations. For mechanical waves, like ultrasound, we instead rely on these three mechanical principles: conservation of mass, the pressure–volume relationship, and Newton’s second law.\n\nIn more advanced, graduate-level courses, we can actually derive the full wave equation from these laws step by step. But for now, the key point is understanding the intuition — waves exist because a local disturbance in pressure or motion creates a self-sustaining pattern that propagates through the medium.\n\nAnd for me personally, this is the fun part — not just using formulas, but really understanding why these waves behave the way they do. Once you grasp these core principles, you can always work out the details later. The details may change from one problem to another, but the underlying physics stays the same. That’s what gives you real insight — and the ability to think beyond just using a device as a “black box.”\n\nSo now, with this foundation, let’s look specifically at how we form an ultrasound wave.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

Let’s break this down step by step.\nThink about how ordinary sound travels through air. You can hear my voice because the sound waves — or pressure waves — travel from me to you through the air. Now imagine replacing the air with water molecules, or even biological tissue. The same principle applies.\n\nLet’s picture a small volume element, or what we might call a voxel, inside that material. Under normal conditions, that voxel is in equilibrium — it has a certain pressure, volume, and position. Nothing’s changing.\n\nBut now, suppose we push on one side of that element toward the right. This causes a displacement, denoted by the lowercase letter w. When we push it, the volume of that little element decreases because the particles are squeezed closer together.\n\nAccording to the conservation of mass, the total amount of material inside that voxel stays the same — but the pressure inside increases. That higher pressure creates a net force on neighboring elements, pushing them forward.\n\nBy Newton’s second law, the net force generates acceleration, which we call a. The acceleration then changes the velocity, denoted by u, and as the velocity builds up, the displacement w also changes further.\n\nSo, you can see that these quantities — displacement (w), velocity (u), acceleration (a), pressure (p), and volume (v) — are all linked together. They interact continuously as the disturbance moves through the medium.\n\nThis is not like pushing a rigid stick, where moving one end instantly moves the other. In a rigid body, everything moves together. But in an elastic medium, local motion depends on these dynamic relationships — one region moves, affects the next, and that disturbance travels as a wave.\n\nSo, an ultrasound wave forms because of this ongoing interplay between pressure, volume, and motion. Push a little, the volume shrinks, pressure rises, acceleration increases, and that disturbance keeps propagating through the material — and that’s your ultrasound wave.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

The displacement, denoted as w, shows how far the boundary moves. In a simple case, displacement is proportional to velocity times time. Mathematically, we write this as w equals u times t.\nThat’s a linear relationship, meaning if you double the velocity, the displacement doubles in the same time period.\n\nBut, on the other side of the same element, the motion doesn’t happen immediately. The molecules there need time to respond, and that brings in acceleration, which we represent as a. The displacement caused by acceleration is a second-order relationship, expressed as w equals one-half times a times t squared.\nSo the first one — w equals u times t — is linear, and the second one — w equals one-half a t squared — is quadratic in time.\n\nThis means when you push on one side of a small tissue element, that side moves first, while the far side lags behind slightly. Because of this delay, the material between them becomes compressed, and pressure increases.\n\nThis process isn’t perfectly synchronized — one side moves first, then the other side catches up. That’s why we get a pressure increment. The delay in motion creates compression, and that’s how the ultrasound wave starts to form.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the combination of displacement, velocity, and acceleration, together with changes in pressure and volume, gives us the basic mechanism of wave formation in tissue.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

So, if you look along the depth of the tissue, every point is moving up and down in the same pattern, but with a small phase delay.\n\nThat delay is what makes the wave travel forward. You still see the same waveform shape, but each point along the medium is slightly out of sync — slightly shifted in phase.\n\nThat’s what we call wave propagation — the motion is passed from one particle to the next, not instantaneously, but through a sequence of tiny, delayed reactions.\nIf the material were completely rigid, like a solid stick, every part would move together at once, and there would be no wave. But because biological tissue is elastic, parts of it move at slightly different times — and that’s exactly what allows the wave to form and travel.\n\nMathematically, if we focus on one physical quantity — say displacement w, or pressure p — and express all the other variables, like acceleration and velocity, in terms of that single variable, we can combine them into a single second-order differential equation.\n\nThat equation is called the wave equation, and it beautifully describes how the disturbance moves through the medium as a function of both space and time.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

In one dimension, it looks like this: partial squared W over partial Z squared equals one over C squared times partial squared W over partial T squared. So what does that mean? It means that the second derivative of displacement, W, with respect to space, Z, is equal to one over C squared times the second derivative of W with respect to time, T. In plain words, the way the wave changes in space is directly linked to how it changes in time. Space and time are tied together through this relationship. You can even think of it conceptually as “space equals time” — not literally, but in a second-derivative sense. This symmetry is what gives rise to those beautiful, smooth, repeating sinusoidal waves we see in sound or vibration.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the speed of sound, denoted by C. C depends on two key material properties — density, which we call rho, and compressibility, which we call kappa. The relationship is given by this equation: C equals one divided by the square root of kappa times rho. Here, rho — written as the Greek letter ρ — represents the density of the tissue, and kappa — the Greek letter κ — represents compressibility, which is actually the inverse of the bulk modulus, or in other words, how stiff the material is.\n\nNow here’s the interesting part. The stiffer the tissue, the smaller the compressibility. And when compressibility is small, the wave travels faster. So, in biological tissues, sound typically moves at about fifteen hundred meters per second — that’s roughly the speed in soft tissue or water. But in bone, which is much stiffer, the speed can reach around four thousand meters per second. And clinically, this becomes quite important. For example, a malignant tumor tends to be harder than normal tissue. That means sound travels faster through it. So in ultrasound elastography, we can actually measure that difference in speed to assess tissue stiffness — and that helps identify abnormalities like tumors.\n\nSo this simple equation — the wave equation — doesn’t just tell us how sound moves; it also connects directly to the mechanical properties of the body — its density, its stiffness, and its elasticity. That’s the physical foundation of how ultrasound works.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

Remember what we discussed earlier — when you push a volume of air in one direction and then release it, the molecules move back and forth along that same line. This back-and-forth motion produces a longitudinal wave, where regions of compression and rarefaction travel in the same direction as the wave. That’s what we call a P-wave, or pressure wave. In ultrasound, this is the type of wave we use — the longitudinal wave traveling through soft tissue.\n\nNow, if we compare that to a transverse wave, the vibration direction is completely different. Instead of moving along the same line, the oscillation happens perpendicular to the wave’s direction. So if the wave moves horizontally, the vibration is up and down. This is exactly what happens with electromagnetic waves, like light or radio waves — their electric and magnetic fields vibrate at right angles to the direction the wave is moving.\n\nSo, to summarize: in a longitudinal wave, the vibration and propagation directions are the same, while in a transverse wave, they are orthogonal. Both are just different ways energy can propagate through a medium.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

The sound originates from a source, like a vibrating tuning fork. In fact, in the old days, doctors would use a tuning fork to test hearing — by striking it and moving it near the ear, they could tell if the patient could sense sound through air or through bone conduction. That tuning fork generates a longitudinal sound wave, where the compressions and rarefactions travel along the direction of vibration.\n\nNow, both longitudinal and transverse waves have some key characteristics. They each have a wavelength, which is the distance between two corresponding points — like from one peak to the next, or from one compression to the next. That’s the spatial period of the wave. They also have amplitude, which represents how strong the wave is — the height of a peak or the depth of a trough.\n\nIf you look at the shape of these waves, you’ll notice they form a sinusoidal pattern — this is not a coincidence. Sinusoidal waves naturally arise when solving the wave equation, whether it’s for mechanical or electromagnetic waves. Mathematically, they are fundamental solutions. And in Fourier analysis, we use sinusoidal components — sines and cosines — as building blocks to represent all kinds of signals. So in a way, every complex sound or image signal can be broken down into a sum of simple sine waves.\n\nFinally, remember that the speed of sound is directly connected to the wave equation. The constant you see there — 1 over c squared — represents how the wave travels through a given medium.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

And this speed depends entirely on the material properties — how dense and how stiff the material is. For example, sound waves travel very differently in air, in steel, or in biological tissue.\n\nIf we look at this table, we can see that the speed of sound in air is around 330 meters per second, in lung tissue about 600 meters per second, in fat about 1,450 meters per second, and in soft tissue around 1,540 meters per second. Water is very similar to soft tissue, around 1,480 meters per second, which is why we often use water-based gels in ultrasound coupling. In muscle, the speed is a bit higher, about 1,600 meters per second, and in bone, it reaches as high as 4,000 meters per second.\n\nSo, the denser and stiffer the material, the faster the sound travels through it. But within the same medium, like soft tissue, the speed stays constant — it’s a property of the material itself. What we can vary is the frequency of vibration. When we increase frequency, the wavelength becomes shorter. So, higher frequency means shorter wavelength, and lower frequency means longer wavelength.\n\nThis relationship between frequency and wavelength is fundamental in ultrasound physics — it helps determine both resolution and penetration in imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

Earlier, we talked about the wave equation in terms of displacement, and if you take the first derivative of displacement with respect to time, you get velocity. That’s what’s shown here in this equation: u  z equals dW over dT.\n\nA typical value for u z, the particle velocity, is around one to ten centimeters per second, which is much smaller than the speed of sound, c. So that’s something to remember — the medium’s particles move slowly, even though the sound wave itself travels fast.\n\nNow, because the sound wave is propagating, it also introduces pressure into the field. That pressure at a given point can be computed as shown here: p equals rho times c times u z. It’s a very straightforward relationship — the pressure is proportional to the density of the medium, the sound speed, and the particle velocity.\nSince the wave equation can be solved, and as I explained before, both the pressure and the velocity take on sinusoidal waveforms, we can represent each of them using an oscillating form — exponential or sinusoidal — like this: p of t equals p naught e to the j omega t, and u z of t equals u naught e to the j omega t. So now, you have both quantities — pressure and velocity — in a sinusoidal oscillation form.\n\nFrom here, we can define intensity, represented by I. The average intensity over a period, capital T, is defined as the product of p and u, averaged over time. Now, let’s think about this physically. Pressure, p, has the unit of force per unit area, so you can think of it as force distributed across a surface.\n\nIf you apply a force to move something over a certain distance, that’s work. So, this is essentially the work you did. But notice that in this case, we’re not talking about displacement or distance directly — u is the rate of change of displacement, or in other words, velocity. That means we’re really talking about the rate at which work is done — and the rate of doing work is power.\n\nSo, if you multiply pressure (which is force per area) by velocity (which is displacement over time), what you get is power per unit area, and that’s exactly what intensity represents. It’s how much power, or energy per unit time, is transmitted through a certain area in the medium.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\u000bPressure, p, corresponds to force per area.\u000bVelocity, u, is displacement per time.\u000bMultiply them together — p times u — and you get work per time per area, or power density, which we call intensity.\nThat’s how these three physical quantities — velocity, pressure, and intensity — are all linked. And even though these can be derived from the wave equation, here we’re just focusing on their basic definitions and physical meanings.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

As the ultrasound wave travels through tissue, it doesn’t stay constant — it gets attenuated. That means the amplitude decreases gradually, and the intensity drops as the wave penetrates deeper. Later, we’ll see that the amplitude or intensity decays exponentially with depth, very similar to Beer’s law in optical physics.\n\nBecause of this, we often use relative intensity and relative power to describe how intensity changes with distance. And since these values can vary across a huge range — sometimes millions of times between the incident pulse and the reflected echo — it’s much easier to express them on a logarithmic scale.\nThis is where the decibel, or dB, scale comes in. It compresses large ratios into smaller, more manageable numbers. So, instead of dealing with enormous values, we talk about relative changes in decibels.\n\nFor ultrasound, pressure intensity is expressed in decibels. The unit of pressure is the Pascal, which is one Newton per square meter. The atmospheric pressure is about 0.1 megaPascal, while diagnostic ultrasound can have a peak pressure of around 1 megaPascal.\n\nNow, we describe relative intensity using the formula 10 log of I2 over I1. This represents the change in intensity between two points. If you’re dealing with power, however, we use 20 log of P2 over P1, because power is proportional to the square of amplitude.\n\nLet me explain that part carefully. In circuit theory, we know that power equals resistance times current squared — P equals R times I squared. The same idea applies here. Since power is proportional to amplitude squared, we need a factor of two in the logarithmic expression. That’s why, for power, we multiply by 20 instead of 10.\n\nSo, in summary:\u000b– When we talk about intensity, we use 10 log because intensity is directly proportional to energy flow.\u000b– When we talk about power, we use 20 log because it depends on amplitude squared.\nA 10 dB change corresponds to a factor of 10 change in intensity.\u000bA 20 dB change corresponds to a factor of 100 change in intensity.\nThis logarithmic relationship is used throughout ultrasound physics because it helps us describe very large variations in intensity and power in a compact, practical way.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

We’ll look at how to calculate remaining intensity and half-value thickness for ultrasound.\nFor the first example, we start with a 100 milliwatt ultrasound pulse that loses 30 decibels as it travels through tissue. Using the formula, negative 30 dB equals 10 log of I2 over 100 milliwatts, we can solve for I2. Rearranging, we get I2 equals 10 to the power of negative three times 100 milliwatts, which equals 0.1 milliwatt. So, after losing 30 dB, the intensity is reduced by a factor of one thousand.\n\nNow, let’s look at the second example — the half-value thickness. This represents the depth at which the ultrasound intensity drops by 50 percent. That means I2 over I1 equals 0.5. Using the decibel formula again, we get 10 log of 0.5 equals negative 3 dB. So, when the intensity is reduced by half, it corresponds to a 3 decibel change.\n\nThis concept is very similar to what we use in X-ray or gamma-ray imaging, where we also talk about a “half-value layer.” It tells us how deep the wave can travel before its intensity is halved.\n\nIn ultrasound, this is just a convenient way to express relative changes using logarithms — there’s no physical constant behind it; it’s simply a mathematical convenience. The decibel scale helps us describe very large or very small intensity ratios in a practical and readable way.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

This concept is actually not dramatically different from what we’ve already learned in electrical circuits. Remember when we studied circuit analysis? We defined resistance as the ratio between voltage and current. Later, we introduced impedance, which included the effects of capacitance and inductance, and again it was defined as voltage over current. The only difference was that, in general, impedance can have a phase shift, so it’s expressed as a complex number — meaning that both voltage and current can be complex, or we can simply describe them in terms of their phase relationship.\n\nNow, think about this analogy in the context of ultrasound. In an electrical circuit, voltage is the driving force — the potential difference that pushes electrons through the conductor. In ultrasound, the driving force is pressure, P. The mechanical wave you push into the medium — that’s the pressure wave. So, just as voltage drives electron motion, pressure drives the particle motion in the tissue.\n\nIn an electrical circuit, current is the flow of electrons. But in ultrasound, no electrons are flowing; instead, the medium’s molecules — air molecules or soft tissue molecules — move back and forth along one direction. At any given location, they have an instantaneous velocity, which we call u z. So, at each point in space, the particles have an instantaneous velocity that’s changing with time.\n\nBoth P and u keep changing with time, but when we solve the wave equation, we find something very interesting. It’s beyond the scope of this lecture to show the full derivation, but the result is that the ratio between pressure and velocity — P over u — is constant at any given location. Even though both pressure and velocity oscillate as the wave propagates, their ratio remains constant in amplitude. Because this ratio stays constant, we can define it as a characteristic property of the medium.\n\nThis constant ratio is what we call acoustic impedance, denoted by Z. If the ratio kept changing, it would depend on position or time, and we couldn’t define it as an intrinsic property of the material. But because it’s stable and characteristic, it gives us something meaningful — a property that tells us how the medium resists the passage of sound.\n\nAcoustic impedance is extremely important in ultrasound imaging. When we use an ultrasound transducer, we have to make sure that the acoustic impedance of the transducer matches the acoustic impedance of the tissue we’re imaging — for example, the abdomen. If there’s a big mismatch between them, the energy cannot enter the body effectively, and you can’t collect the echo signals efficiently. That’s why we use ultrasound gel — it acts as a coupling layer that bridges the impedance gap between the probe and the skin.\n\nSo, to define it heuristically: acoustic impedance is like voltage over current in an electrical system. Here it’s pressure over particle velocity. We can show this mathematically, though I won’t go through the full derivation now. By solving the mechanical wave equation, we can prove that Z is constant and depends only on the material’s intrinsic properties — specifically, density (rho) and sound speed (c).\n\nMathematically, we can write this as Z equals rho times c. And we know that the sound speed, c, can be expressed as one over the square root of rho times kappa, where kappa is the compressibility. So, substituting that into the equation, we get Z equals rho over the square root of rho times kappa, which simplifies to Z equals the square root of rho over kappa.\n\nThis shows that acoustic impedance depends on both density and compressibility, and it is a fundamental property of the material.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

Equation 3.8 and the table shown here give you typical values.\n\nIf you look at the numbers, you can get a feeling for how impedance and sound speed vary across materials. In air, the sound speed is only about 330 meters per second, because air is very light and compressible. In biological tissues like the kidney or liver, the sound speed is much higher — around 1,560 to 1,570 meters per second — because these materials are denser and less compressible.\n\nNow, if you ask where sound travels the fastest inside the human body, the answer is bone, because bone is the densest and stiffest material we have. The table shows a speed of about 3,500 meters per second in bone, which is several times faster than in soft tissue.\nThese are just typical examples of tissue acoustic properties, but they are extremely important for understanding how ultrasound interacts with different parts of the body. The speed of sound, the density, and the impedance all influence how much of the sound wave is transmitted, reflected, or absorbed at tissue boundaries.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

Earlier, we mentioned how different imaging modalities interact with biological tissues. For example, X-ray and CT involve attenuation and scattering, while gamma-ray imaging behaves similarly. In MRI, we talk about T1 and T2 relaxation parameters to describe energy interactions within tissues.\n\nFor ultrasound, the same basic idea applies — it’s all about energy propagation and how that energy interacts with biological structures. The first major effect we talk about is reflection. When a sound wave hits a boundary where there is a difference in acoustic impedance — for example, between air and tissue, or between bone and tissue — some of the energy is reflected. That’s what creates the echoes we use to form ultrasound images.\nReflection happens because of impedance mismatch. If the impedance difference is large, reflection is strong. If the impedances are well matched, reflection is weak, and more energy passes through.\n\nNow, with X-rays and gamma rays, reflection is not really an issue, because their wavelengths are extremely short and the photons are so energetic that they mostly pass straight through. In ultrasound, however, the wavelength is much larger, so reflection becomes significant.\nSo, remember this simple rule: reflection at a boundary means a change in direction.\n\nThe second effect is scattering. When ultrasound waves travel through tissue, they encounter many small structures — cells, organelles, connective fibers — that scatter energy in different directions. So, instead of traveling as a narrow beam, the energy spreads out or diffuses. You can think of this like Compton scattering in X-rays — energy is diffused, and the propagation direction changes randomly.\n\nThe third effect is absorption, which converts mechanical energy into heat. In the case of X-rays, this corresponds to the photoelectric effect, where photon energy is absorbed completely. For ultrasound, as the wave passes through tissue, the molecules oscillate back and forth, and because of internal friction, some of the mechanical energy is lost as heat.\n\nThis leads to attenuation, which is the overall reduction in intensity. Attenuation happens because energy is both absorbed and scattered away. The wave’s amplitude becomes smaller, its pressure decreases, and the particle displacements become weaker as it moves deeper.\n\nIf we look at Figure 3.3, it illustrates how the beam behaves when it meets a boundary between two materials with impedances Z1 and Z2. If the wave hits perpendicularly, part of it is reflected back and part is transmitted forward. In more general cases, where the wave hits the surface at an angle, we define the incident angle (theta i), the reflected angle (theta r), and the transmitted angle (theta t). The incident angle equals the reflected angle, but the transmission angle can differ depending on the material properties.\n\nThe energy divides between reflection and transmission, and the total energy always equals the incident energy. The ratios of reflected to transmitted energy can be expressed in terms of pressure amplitude, and when you square those amplitudes, you get the intensity ratios.\n\nThese ratios depend on the acoustic impedance values of the two materials, Z1 and Z2, as well as the angles of incidence and transmission.\nIf Z1 equals Z2 — meaning the materials are identical — there will be no reflection at all, and all the energy will pass straight through. But if the impedances are very different — for example, if one of them is close to zero — then the reflection coefficient becomes one, meaning all the energy is reflected back.\n\nThat’s why impedance matching is so important in ultrasound imaging — it ensures that most of the sound energy enters the body instead of being reflected away at the surface.\n\nSo, in summary, ultrasound–tissue interaction involves five main effects: reflection, refraction, scattering, absorption, and attenuation. Together, these determine how the ultrasound wave propagates, how it loses energy, and how we detect it for image formation.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

And the reason both intensity and pressure amplitude become smaller and smaller is due to attenuation.\n\nNow, why do we have attenuation? Because we have two main effects: absorption and scattering. Some of the energy is absorbed and turned into heat, while some is scattered — redirected into other directions. Along the main beam direction, the intensity keeps getting smaller, and the pressure amplitude also decreases.\nThis is not a strange concept to us — we’ve seen exponential decay many times before. In nuclear imaging in X-ray imaging, exponential decay appears everywhere. It’s a very common phenomenon. And every time we see exponential decay, we can use it to understand how strongly our target interacts with the probing beam. Based on the attenuation rate, we can tell how dense or how light certain tissues are.\nThat’s really the imaging mechanism — attenuation gives us contrast.\n\nNow, the same logic applies here as with X-rays. You don’t want something that absorbs energy too quickly. If all the X-rays — or all the ultrasound — are absorbed by the body, then the detector sees nothing. Every photon, or every bit of energy, gets eaten up, and no information is carried out.\nBut on the other hand, you also don’t want the ultrasound beam to pass through the body without any attenuation. If everything goes through unchanged, again, you get no information.\n\nThe ideal situation is somewhere in between — you want about half the energy absorbed, and half transmitted. Not exactly fifty–fifty in every case, but roughly half. That balance gives you the maximum contrast and allows you to reconstruct a meaningful tomographic image.\n\nNow, I often make this analogy with exams. When I give you an examination, I try to set it up so that the class average is around fifty percent. Why? Because that gives me the best spread — I can see which questions are tricky and which ones you can solve easily. It allows me to judge relative performance much more clearly. So, don’t worry if your average score isn’t high. I purposely don’t aim for a high average, because it gives me better information about the class as a whole. And in the end, your final letter grades — A, B, or C — are assigned consistently with the overall performance distribution. So nobody is unfairly graded.\n\nComing back to imaging, the same principle applies. The attenuation curve gives us the contrast we need — not too much, not too little. And in ultrasound, we often use two equivalent forms to describe it: μ, the attenuation coefficient for intensity, and α, the attenuation coefficient for pressure. These are just two different ways to express the same exponential decay behavior. On a decibel scale, μ and α become interchangeable.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

Mathematically, we often write this as alpha of f equals alpha-naught times f to the power of b.\n\nFor diagnostic ultrasound, the value of b is about one, which means the relationship is almost linear. In other words, as the frequency increases, attenuation increases linearly.\nSo, higher frequency means stronger attenuation. And that makes perfect sense physically. Think about it: when you vibrate molecules more frequently, they move back and forth faster. Faster motion means more friction inside the tissue, and that friction converts energy into heat. So, higher frequency means you lose energy faster — the wave decays in intensity and amplitude more quickly.\nIn simple terms: higher frequency equals higher energy loss equals less penetration.\n\nNow, for different types of materials, the constant α-naught is different. If you look at the table on the slide, you’ll see that fat has a smaller α-naught value, while liver is a little higher. Cardiac muscle is higher still, and bone has a very large value — meaning sound doesn’t penetrate bone very well.\n\nYou can use these numbers to get a sense of how attenuation works in different tissues. For example, let’s take fat at 5 megahertz. You can calculate attenuation as five megahertz times zero point six three decibels per centimeter per megahertz, which equals about three point one five decibels per centimeter. After traveling four centimeters, that’s twelve point six decibels of attenuation. The relative amplitude of the wave becomes ten to the power of negative twelve point six divided by twenty, which is about zero point two three four.\n\nSo, as frequency increases, attenuation increases. That’s why in medical ultrasound we always have to make a trade-off: high frequency gives you better resolution but less depth, while low frequency penetrates deeper but gives you lower resolution.\nThe takeaway is simple and important: higher frequency → larger attenuation coefficient → less penetration depth.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

When there’s a large mismatch in impedance, most of the ultrasound energy is reflected, and very little gets through.\n\nAlso, if you try to do brain imaging in vivo, the skull will reflect almost all of the ultrasound. That’s why we don’t use ultrasound to image the brain the same way we use CT or MRI. The bone–tissue boundary is such a strong reflector that almost no energy gets inside.\nEven inside the brain, gray matter and white matter are acoustically very uniform. In a uniform medium, the ultrasound wave passes straight through without much change — kind of like a transparent window. But that also means you don’t get contrast. It’s like when everyone in the class scores a perfect 100 — I can’t tell who is better, because everyone looks the same.\n\nOn the other extreme, if you have a strong mismatch — for example, at a tissue–bone interface — the ultrasound wave cannot penetrate at all. Everything is reflected. That’s like an exam where everyone scores zero — again, I can’t tell who’s better.\nSo, what we really need is a good balance — a useful imaging window. In practice, this means finding acoustic windows that allow sound to enter effectively. For instance, when imaging the heart, we position the probe around the ribs to find a small gap where the sound can pass through. We also make sure to use ultrasound gel between the transducer and the skin, because that gel helps match the impedance between the probe and the tissue. Without it, the air gap would cause almost total reflection, and no signal would enter the body.\n\nSo the key idea is this: reflection depends on impedance mismatch. If there’s too little mismatch, there’s no contrast — everything looks uniform. But if the mismatch is too large, nothing penetrates — you can’t see anything. The useful imaging window lies in between.\nThis is something I’ve mentioned before, and you can read through the bullet points on the slide to reinforce the idea. The goal is always the same: find the right balance between reflection and transmission to get good imaging quality.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

When we introduce ultrasound energy into the body, it can lead to two kinds of effects: thermal effects and non-thermal effects.\n\nI’ve already mentioned the thermal effects earlier, but let’s quickly recall them. When ultrasound travels through tissue, part of its mechanical energy gets converted into heat. This heating can cause several physiological changes — for instance, it can increase collagen tissue extensibility, which makes soft tissues more flexible. It can also increase blood flow, which improves circulation and oxygen delivery. In addition, it can increase nerve conduction velocity, meaning that nerve impulses travel faster. This effect can also raise the pain threshold, allowing patients to tolerate more discomfort during therapy.\nMoreover, heating can enhance enzymatic activity — many enzymes in the body function more efficiently at slightly elevated temperatures. And finally, ultrasound heating can help decrease muscle spasm, relaxing the tissue and improving mobility.\n\nNow, in addition to these thermal effects, ultrasound also causes non-thermal effects, and these are especially fascinating. Non-thermal effects are not caused by heating; instead, they result from mechanical interaction with the tissue — the actual pressure waves and oscillations in the medium.\nFor example, ultrasound can increase cell membrane permeability, allowing molecules to move in and out of cells more easily. It can also increase vascular permeability, which means that blood vessels become slightly more “leaky,” allowing nutrients or drugs to diffuse through more effectively. Both of these effects are very useful in therapeutic and drug delivery applications.\n\nUltrasound can also increase local blood flow without significant heating, helping tissue repair and regeneration. It can assist in the reduction of edema, which is the accumulation of fluid in tissues, and that makes it very useful for treating inflammation or swelling.\nOne of the most remarkable non-thermal effects is something called cavitation. Cavitation refers to the formation and oscillation of tiny bubbles — microscopic gas pockets — in the tissue fluid. At certain frequencies and intensities, these bubbles can oscillate and even collapse, releasing bursts of mechanical energy that can affect nearby cells or molecules.\n\nAs shown in the figure on this slide, you can see different frequency ranges where ultrasound is applied — from very low frequencies used in physiotherapy to higher frequencies used in imaging, Doppler studies, and even lithotripsy for breaking kidney stones. The likelihood of cavitation increases with lower frequency and higher acoustic pressure. However, for standard medical diagnostic ultrasound, which operates between about 3 and 20 megahertz, cavitation is highly unlikely, so it’s very safe.\nAlso notice the lower figure — it shows how ultrasound can enhance drug delivery. The red curve shows a larger uptake of drug when ultrasound is applied, compared to the blue curve, which shows little uptake without ultrasound. This demonstrates how ultrasound can help drugs penetrate biological barriers more effectively.\n\nSo, in summary, ultrasound has both thermal and non-thermal effects, and both can be used for different therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. The non-thermal effects, like increased permeability and cavitation, open up some exciting possibilities — such as ultrasound-mediated drug delivery and neurological stimulation. These are emerging areas of research and clinical application.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

These next few slides focus on the ultrasound scanner, or sometimes we call it the ultrasound probe or transducer. All these terms basically refer to the same device.\n\nSo, in this next part, we’ll first talk about the single ultrasound unit, and then how multiple such units are combined to form arrays — either linear arrays for one-dimensional scanning, or two-dimensional arrays for volumetric imaging. This is actually quite similar to how a CT scanner is organized — you have multiple detectors arranged in a specific pattern to collect information from different angles.\n\nWe’ll also talk about image resolution, contrast, and microbubbles, which are tiny gas-filled spheres used as ultrasound contrast agents. These help us visualize blood flow and enhance tissue contrast in medical imaging.\n\nSo again, just to summarize — the first part of this lecture covered the physical foundations, while this next part is all about the engineering principles of the ultrasound scanner itself: how it’s built, how it operates, and how it detects signals.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

Those are good heuristic examples to understand the idea. But for medical ultrasound, we need something that can vibrate millions of times per second — far beyond what we can do by hand. So, we use a physical mechanism called the piezoelectric effect.\n\nThe piezoelectric effect is truly fundamental to ultrasound imaging — it’s the enabling technology behind both the generation and detection of ultrasound waves. In fact, this phenomenon was so important that it earned recognition at the Nobel Prize level.\nNow, the piezoelectric effect works in two directions, which we call the direct effect and the reverse effect.\nLet’s start with the direct effect. When sound vibrations — that is, pressure waves — hit a piezoelectric crystal, the alternating pressure causes the crystal to deform mechanically. As the pressure oscillates from positive to negative, the crystal expands and contracts slightly. This mechanical deformation generates an electrical potential across its surfaces. In other words, mechanical energy — the sound vibration — is converted into electrical energy. This is how the ultrasound echo signal is detected by the transducer and turned into an electrical signal for processing.\n\nNow, the reverse effect works the other way around. When we apply a voltage across the piezoelectric crystal, it causes the crystal to deform — to change shape. When the voltage alternates — positive, then negative, then positive again — the crystal vibrates back and forth. If that electrical signal has a frequency in the ultrasound range, those vibrations produce ultrasound waves that propagate into the surrounding medium.\nSo you can see that the same piezoelectric element can do both jobs — it can generate ultrasound waves and also detect the returning echoes.\nHere’s how it all fits together: when you send a sinusoidal electrical signal to the crystal, it vibrates and emits an ultrasound wave that travels into the body. The wave reflects from tissue boundaries and returns to the transducer. Those returning pressure waves deform the crystal again, and the deformation creates an electrical signal that can be measured.\n\nThat’s why we call it a two-way transduction process — it goes from electrical energy to mechanical energy when we transmit, and back from mechanical to electrical energy when we receive.\nThis process — the piezoelectric effect — is the heart of every ultrasound transducer. It allows the probe to both send and receive sound waves, enabling us to form detailed medical images.\n\nSo, when you see the term “piezoelectric ceramics” or “piezoelectric crystals,” just remember: that’s what’s inside every ultrasound probe, converting electrical energy to sound and sound back to electrical energy, millions of times every second.\nAnd that’s the essence of how ultrasound imaging becomes possible.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

What’s going on inside the material that allows it to generate electricity when we apply pressure?\u000bThis little cartoon, or infographic, explains it beautifully.\n\nImagine you have a crystal structure, such as quartz, that is in perfect static balance — both mechanically and electrically. In its no-stress state, the positive and negative charges are arranged symmetrically. The positive charges — usually from the silicon atoms — and the negative charges — from the oxygen atoms — balance one another out, so the overall crystal is electrically neutral. There is no net polarization, no voltage across the surfaces.\n\nNow, let’s apply a horizontal tension — we’re stretching the crystal, pulling its sides apart. The crystal is stable but elastic, so it deforms slightly. When that happens, the charge centers shift — the positive charges move upward, and the negative charges move downward. That means the top surface becomes slightly positive, and the bottom surface becomes slightly negative. In other words, the mechanical strain has produced an electrical potential difference between the two surfaces.\nNow imagine the opposite — a compression instead of tension. When we compress the crystal, we push those atoms closer together, but in the opposite direction. The negative charges are forced upward, and the positive charges are pushed downward. Now the top surface becomes negative, and the bottom surface becomes positive.\n\nThis alternation between tension and compression causes repeated charge separation, which is what generates an alternating voltage when the material is vibrated continuously.\n\nSo what you see in this diagram — the shift of positive and negative charge centers — is the fundamental reason behind the piezoelectric effect. Mechanical deformation creates electrical polarization, and electrical excitation can, in turn, create mechanical motion.\nThis is the microscopic picture that explains how piezoelectric crystals act as transducers, converting mechanical vibration into electrical energy and back again. It’s this static-electric imbalance, produced by strain, that forms the very foundation of ultrasound imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

At the heart of the transducer is the piezoelectric crystal, the active element that generates and receives ultrasound waves. On one side, there is a matching layer, which I mentioned earlier — it’s used to match the acoustic impedance of the crystal to that of the tissue. Without this layer, much of the energy would be reflected at the interface, and very little sound would enter the body.\n\nBehind the crystal, you’ll see a damping material. This is essential because it absorbs unwanted echoes and stops the crystal from ringing after each pulse. The damping material ensures that the emitted pulse is short and well-defined, giving us better axial resolution in the image.\n\nSurrounding everything, there’s an acoustic insulator or backing, which directs the ultrasound wave forward into the tissue rather than allowing it to leak backward into the housing. There’s also a conducting wire, or contact lead, which connects to the electrical circuitry, allowing us to apply voltage across the crystal and receive electrical signals from it.\nAll of these components — the crystal, the matching layer, the damping material, and the insulator — are enclosed in a metal or plastic housing, often with an ergonomic handle. Together they form what we call a single-element transducer.\nMathematically, this crystal has a natural resonant frequency, denoted as f-zero, given by the formula f-zero equals the speed of sound in the crystal divided by twice its thickness.\u000bIn other words,\u000bF-Zero equals c-crystal over 2 d.\n\nSo, the frequency of the ultrasound wave is determined by how fast sound travels in the crystal and how thick the crystal is. A thinner crystal produces higher frequency sound, while a thicker one produces lower frequency sound.\n\nThis simple relationship between frequency, sound speed, and crystal thickness is fundamental to designing ultrasound probes for different applications. High-frequency probes, which give better resolution, use very thin crystals, while low-frequency probes, which penetrate deeper, use thicker ones.\nSo, this diagram gives you the complete picture — from physical design to mathematical principle — of a single-crystal transducer.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

These probes are used for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.\n\nOn this slide, you can see several examples of commercial ultrasound probes. Each one is designed for a different purpose — some are curved for abdominal imaging, some are linear for vascular or musculoskeletal scans, and others are very small for intracavitary or ophthalmic use.\n\nNow, I’d like to share a more forward-looking idea — something I’ve been thinking about for quite a while. I believe that in the future, our everyday devices — maybe even the iPhone — could incorporate this kind of piezoelectric technology directly into the screen.\n\nJust imagine that the phone’s surface could act as a two-dimensional acoustic transducer array. Each tiny pixel on the screen could both generate and receive ultrasound signals. That means you could, in principle, perform a quick body scan right at home — maybe before going to bed.\nYou could place the phone on your skin, and the device would automatically send out ultrasound waves, collect the echoes, and the AI software inside would analyze the data for you. It might tell you, “Everything looks fine,” or “You may want to check this area further.” It could even show you which parts of the body were already scanned and which ones weren’t.\n\nBy combining piezoelectric technology, machine learning, and digital signal processing, we could one day make personal, professional-level imaging accessible to everyone — right from their own phone.\n\nThis might sound futuristic, but remember — all great innovations start as ideas.

Most of the time, ultrasound imaging doesn’t use a continuous wave; instead, it operates in what we call a pulsed mode. You send out a pulse, it travels into the body, reflects from different tissue layers, and then comes back to the transducer as an echo. This pulsed approach is extremely useful because it allows us to measure both depth and velocity — that is, how deep a structure is and how fast it’s moving.\n\nNow, let’s say you apply a short electrical signal to the piezoelectric crystal — it vibrates for a moment and produces a burst of ultrasound waves. Then, you stop the input signal. Ideally, the crystal should also stop vibrating immediately, just like striking a bell and having it stop ringing right away. But in reality, if there’s no damping, the crystal keeps vibrating for quite a while after the excitation stops, almost like a bouncing ball that never settles down.\n\nIf there’s no damping — no internal friction — the ball keeps bouncing up and down forever. That’s exactly what would happen to your transducer: it would continue ringing, creating a long, drawn-out pulse. But we don’t want that, because a long pulse means poor resolution — the returning echoes overlap and you lose clarity.\nNow, if the transducer is placed in a medium with some friction — like air or fluid — those vibrations die out faster. The amplitude drops quickly, and you get a much shorter pulse. This reduction in vibration amplitude is called damping.\n\nSo, when we apply a damping material behind the crystal, it acts like friction for the vibrating transducer. It absorbs the leftover energy, preventing it from ringing too long. In the time domain, that means the vibration decays faster, giving us a short, clean pulse. In the frequency domain, the pulse now covers a wider range of frequencies — in other words, a broader bandwidth with a lower amplitude peak.\n\nWithout damping, you have a narrow and tall frequency spectrum — that’s a very sharp resonance around the central frequency. With damping, the spectrum is broader and flatter — the amplitude is smaller, but the bandwidth is much wider, which is exactly what we want for imaging.\nWe define this relationship using something called the Q factor, or the quality factor. Mathematically, Q equals two pi times the central frequency divided by the bandwidth. So, Q equals 2πf₀ divided by BW.\n\nA high-Q system means low damping — long vibration, narrow frequency range. A low-Q system means strong damping — short vibration, wide frequency range.\nFor diagnostic ultrasound, we actually prefer low-Q systems because we want short pulses and broad bandwidths. Typically, the Q factor is around 1 or 2, which provides an ideal balance between good axial resolution and manageable signal strength.\n\nSo, damping is what makes our ultrasound pulses short, our echoes sharp, and our images clear.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

The gel is completely harmless and painless, though yes, it can feel a little messy. But that gel is doing something very important — it’s not just for comfort or for better contact. It actually helps solve what we call a matching problem.\n\nHere’s why. The piezoelectric material inside the transducer, usually something like PZT — that stands for lead zirconate titanate — has a very high acoustic impedance, which we call Z P or Z transducer. The human skin, on the other hand, has a much lower acoustic impedance, which we call Z skin. And between the two surfaces there are often tiny air bubbles, because the skin isn’t perfectly smooth. Now, whenever two materials with very different acoustic impedances are in contact, most of the ultrasound energy reflects back instead of transmitting forward. So the ultrasound wave generated by the crystal would mostly bounce back at the surface — kind of like shouting into a canyon and hearing your echo. That’s bad for imaging because very little energy actually enters the body.\n\nSo what do we do? We introduce a matching layer — a thin material layer whose acoustic impedance lies between those two values. This layer acts as a bridge, transferring acoustic energy more efficiently from the transducer into the skin. Here’s how it works. The vibration from the crystal first transfers its energy into the matching layer, and then from the matching layer into the skin. So instead of one big impedance jump, we now have two smaller steps — from crystal to matching layer, and from matching layer to skin.\n\nMathematically, the amount of energy that gets transmitted from one medium into another depends on their respective acoustic impedances. The transmitted intensity between two media is proportional to the product of their impedances divided by the square of their sum — that’s shown in the equation on the slide. To optimize this transmission, we choose the impedance of the matching layer carefully. The ideal acoustic impedance of the matching layer, which we call Z M, is the geometric mean of the two adjacent impedances. So we say, Z M equals the square root of Z transducer multiplied by Z skin. Again, that’s Z M equals the square root of Z transducer times Z skin.\n\nThis relationship minimizes reflection and maximizes transmission, allowing most of the ultrasound energy to enter the body and come back to the transducer as echoes. That’s why every ultrasound probe has a matching layer built in, and that’s also why we always use gel on the skin — the gel acts as an acoustic coupling medium that functions as part of the matching layer system. And by the way, as you can see on the slide, this topic might appear in your homework, so make sure you remember it.\n\nTo summarize: without the matching layer, most of the ultrasound energy would just reflect at the skin’s surface. With the matching layer — and with the gel acting as a coupling medium — the energy is transmitted efficiently, first from the crystal to the gel, then from the gel to the body. This ensures stronger echoes, clearer signals, and higher-quality ultrasound images.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

You’ve probably seen this many times during a scan, whether it’s for the abdomen, the heart, or during pregnancy imaging. The sonographer or the doctor squeezes out some gel and spreads it on the patient’s skin before placing the transducer on top. It may seem simple, but it actually plays a crucial physical role in ultrasound imaging.\n\nRemember, we just discussed the matching layer — that thin layer designed to help ultrasound energy travel efficiently from the transducer into the body. Well, the ultrasound gel is part of that same idea. It acts as an acoustic coupling medium, helping to eliminate the air gap between the transducer and the skin. Without the gel, there would be a very thin layer of air between the probe and the body surface, and that’s a serious problem.\n\nWhy? Because air has an extremely low acoustic impedance — much lower than either the piezoelectric crystal or human tissue. When an ultrasound wave tries to go from the crystal into air, almost all of the energy reflects. In fact, more than ninety-nine percent of the signal would be lost. So the ultrasound beam would never enter the body; you’d see nothing but noise on the screen.\n\nThe gel solves this problem beautifully. It has an acoustic impedance value that lies roughly between the impedance of the transducer surface and that of the skin, just like a matching layer. When the gel fills in the microscopic irregularities on the skin and removes any trapped air bubbles, it creates a smooth, continuous path for the sound waves to travel through. That means more ultrasound energy gets transmitted into the body, and stronger echoes come back to the transducer.\n\nSo, in simple terms, the gel makes sure there’s no air, only sound transmission. It improves image quality dramatically, ensuring clear boundaries and accurate echo measurements. It also helps the probe glide smoothly across the skin, which is important for maintaining good contact during a scan.\n\nAnd practically speaking, the gel is made of a water-based polymer that’s safe, non-toxic, and easily cleaned off after the exam. Some gels are even warmed up before use to make the patient more comfortable. But whether it’s warm or cold, the gel is essential — without it, even the best transducer couldn’t produce a good image.\n\nSo the next time you see that ultrasound gel being applied, remember it’s not just for comfort — it’s a critical part of the acoustic system. It’s what allows the ultrasound energy to move efficiently from the transducer, through the skin, and into the body, giving us clear, high-quality medical images.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

In most modern ultrasound systems, the transducers are not just a single piezoelectric element like we saw earlier — they’re made up of arrays of elements, either one-dimensional or two-dimensional. The image you see here is a schematic of a one-dimensional linear array transducer, which is very common in medical ultrasound imaging.\n\nYou can see that each piezo element is one tiny rectangular piece of piezoelectric material. Beneath these elements, we have the electrodes, which are used to apply oscillating sinusoidal electrical signals. These electrical signals cause the piezo elements to vibrate and generate ultrasound waves — and when echoes return from the body, those same elements work in reverse, converting mechanical vibration back into electrical signals.\n\nNow, above these piezoelectric elements, you can see matching layers — sometimes there are two, a first and a second matching layer. These are just like what we discussed earlier: they help transfer ultrasound energy more efficiently into the body by gradually matching the acoustic impedance between the crystal and the skin. The entire system is connected to a custom-designed flexible circuit that allows precise timing and control for each element, enabling electronic focusing and beam steering.\n\nBehind the piezo elements is the backing layer, which provides damping — it absorbs unwanted vibrations so that each pulse is short and clean. This improves axial resolution by preventing long “ringing” of the crystal. So, when everything is working together — the electrode, the matching layers, the gel, and the backing layer — the ultrasound energy is efficiently transmitted into the body, and the echoes return through the same path.\n\nIn essence, you have a system that is symmetrically optimized for both transmission and reception. The signal path forward is carefully matched, and the reverse path follows the same principle, leading to a higher signal-to-noise ratio and better overall image quality.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

This is a very important concept that determines how clearly you can see structures at different depths inside the body.\n\nIf you want to get higher resolution, generally you need to increase the frequency of your ultrasound wave. Higher frequency means a shorter wavelength, and that allows you to distinguish smaller structures — that’s why high-frequency ultrasound is used for imaging shallow organs like the thyroid or the eye.\n\nHowever, there’s a price you pay for this. Higher frequency sound waves are attenuated much faster as they travel through tissue. Remember that the attenuation coefficient, alpha, is proportional to frequency — we can say alpha is proportional to f. So, as frequency increases, attenuation also increases. That means the ultrasound wave loses energy faster, and it can’t penetrate as deeply into the body.\n\nIn contrast, a lower frequency transducer can send energy much deeper, but it comes with lower resolution. For example, a 12 megahertz transducer provides excellent resolution but can’t reach very deep — maybe just a few centimeters. On the other hand, a 3 megahertz transducer can reach much deeper into the abdomen, but the image will be coarser.\n\nSo, in practice, we always balance these two factors. You choose your transducer frequency based on the target you want to image — high frequency for fine detail near the surface, and low frequency for deeper penetration. This is one of the most fundamental trade-offs in ultrasound imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

This figure from your textbook shows the beam shape produced by a single crystal transducer.\nWhen the transducer vibrates, it sends energy downward in a conical shape. The region closest to the transducer is called the near field, and beyond a certain point — called the near field boundary — the beam starts to diverge, entering what we call the far field.\n\nIn the near field, the beam diameter is roughly the same as the transducer’s aperture — so if the transducer has a diameter “a,” the beam width is about the same. But after the near field boundary, the beam starts to spread out or diverge. This divergence angle, which we call theta, is determined by the wavelength lambda and the transducer aperture “a.” It’s given approximately by the equation:\n\ntheta equals arc sine of zero point six one times lambda divided by a.\n\nThis relationship shows that smaller apertures or larger wavelengths give wider beams — meaning poorer lateral resolution.\nNow, within any cross-section of the beam, the intensity isn’t uniform. Along the central axis, the signal is strongest, and as you move away to the sides, the intensity decreases. The intensity profile across the beam can often be approximated by a Gaussian distribution, meaning it has a peak at the center and falls off symmetrically.\nTo describe this beam width, we use a quantity called full width at half maximum, or F-W-H-M, which literally means the width of the beam where the intensity drops to half of its peak value. For a Gaussian profile, the FWHM is approximately two point three six times sigma, where sigma is the standard deviation of the Gaussian. Mathematically, we write it as:\n\nFWHM equals two times the square root of two times the natural log of two, multiplied by sigma — approximately equal to two point three six sigma.\nThis measurement gives us a good estimate of the lateral resolution of the ultrasound beam. The narrower the beam, the better the lateral resolution — meaning you can distinguish two nearby structures more clearly.\n\nSo, beam geometry, frequency, aperture size, and attenuation — all these factors together define how sharp and how deep your ultrasound image will be.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

Remember earlier, we talked about the beam profile and how it has a certain width, which we describe using the full width at half maximum, or F-W-H-M. Ideally, we want this width to be as small as possible, because that determines how well we can distinguish two objects that are side by side.\n\nIf two scatterers in the body — say, two small reflecting points — are separated by a distance smaller than the beam width, their echoes will overlap when received by the transducer. When that happens, the signals blend, and we can’t tell them apart. That’s what you see on the right side of the figure: the two curves merge into one, and the system records them as a single echo.\n\nOn the other hand, if the two scatterers are separated by a distance greater than the beam width — specifically, greater than the full width at half maximum — then the two echoes appear as two distinct peaks. That’s what we want. So the smaller the F-W-H-M, the better your lateral resolution, because you can separate two adjacent points in space.\n\nSo in summary, lateral resolution is determined primarily by the beam width. Narrow beams resolve closely spaced objects; wide beams cause overlap. This concept applies directly to your image sharpness — particularly in the direction perpendicular to the beam path.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

You can think of this just like focusing light through a lens in photography. The figure here from your textbook shows three cases: strong focusing, weak focusing, and a reference to how the focal plane and focal distance change.\n\nIf we have a single-crystal transducer — often shaped like a disk — it can have a concave surface, meaning it curves inward. The curvature acts like an optical lens, helping to converge the ultrasound beam to a smaller focal spot. When the curvature is stronger, the beam converges faster, giving us a shorter focal distance and a tighter focus. That means, at that focal point, you have very high resolution — the beam is extremely narrow, and you can separate fine structures clearly. However, beyond that focal plane, the beam quickly diverges again, and the resolution deteriorates.\n\nIf the transducer surface is only slightly curved, the focusing is weaker. The focal distance becomes longer, and the beam stays more uniform downstream. The resolution isn’t as sharp at the focal point, but it’s more consistent along the depth of field. So there’s always a trade-off — strong focusing gives you very high resolution over a small region, while weak focusing gives you moderate resolution over a wider range.\n\nNow, in both optics and acoustics, we use a quantity called the F-number, or F-ratio, to describe focusing strength. The F-number is defined as the radius of curvature divided by twice the aperture radius. Mathematically, that’s:\nF equals R divided by two A.\n\nHere, R is the radius of curvature, and A is the aperture radius. So, a smaller R or a larger aperture A gives you a smaller F-number — meaning stronger focusing. Conversely, a large F-number corresponds to weaker focusing.\n\nSo what we’re really describing here is how lateral resolution changes as a function of focusing strength and imaging depth. When you design an ultrasound system, you must decide whether you want a narrow beam with strong focusing or a broader, more uniform beam with weaker focusing, depending on your imaging application.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}
{"lecture": "Lecture 21", "slide_number": 39, "slide_filename": "Slide39.txt", "slide_annotation": "Lecture 21 - Slide39.txt", "file_path": "Lecture 21\\Texts\\Slide39.txt", "content": "Alright, so we’ve talked about lateral resolution — how well we can distinguish two points that are side by side. Now let’s move on to the next concept, which is axial resolution, or sometimes called longitudinal resolution — meaning how well we can distinguish two points along the direction of beam propagation.\n\nIf you look at this figure, it might seem a little tricky at first glance, but let’s walk through it carefully together. To understand axial resolution, remember that in ultrasound imaging we always send out short bursts, or pulses, of sound — not continuous waves. We need these pulses, and as we mentioned before when talking about damping, that damping helps shorten the pulse. A shorter pulse means better resolution.\n\nSo imagine you send out one pulse. You already know the speed of sound in the medium, so after a short while, the pulse travels outward, interacts with the tissue, and part of it comes back as an echo. Based on the time interval between when we send the pulse and when we receive the echo, we can calculate the round-trip distance the sound wave has traveled.\n\nNow, if I send another pulse right after the first one, the same process repeats — it goes out, reflects, and comes back. The key here is that axial resolution tells us how well we can resolve separate boundaries along that same line of travel. So the big question is: what’s the smallest distance between two reflecting surfaces that we can still tell apart? That minimum separable distance is what we call the axial resolution.\n\nIf those two boundaries are too close together, the echoes from them will overlap — just like what you see in this figure — and when that happens, all the signals merge, so you can’t tell which one is which. They just blur into one single reflection.\nFrom this physical reasoning, we can define the formula for axial resolution. It’s given by one-half times the pulse duration times the speed of sound. Let me say that clearly — axial resolution equals one-half times pulse duration times c, where c represents the speed of sound in the medium.\n\nSo, mathematically, that’s:\u000bAxial resolution equals one-half multiplied by pulse duration multiplied by c.\nThis comes from a simple idea. For a first-order approximation, we assume the speed of sound is uniform throughout the tissue. Then we can look at which factors matter most. There are two major players here: the pulse duration and the sound speed. The smaller the pulse duration, the better the resolution. And actually, a smaller sound speed also improves resolution, because the wave doesn’t travel as far during each time interval.\n\nNow, picture this in your mind. You send out a pulse — it has a certain length, from the front, which we call the leading edge, to the back, which we call the trailing edge. This whole pulse moves through the tissue. As it moves, it hits boundaries — let’s call them surface A and surface B. The leading edge of the pulse reaches surface A first and reflects back, while the trailing part continues forward. Some portion of the pulse keeps going and hits surface B, and then that part reflects back too.\n\nSo the leading edge reflects first, and a moment later, the trailing edge and the transmitted component reach the second boundary. The reflected waves from surface A and surface B both travel back toward the transducer. Now, if these two boundaries are so close that the time difference between those reflections is shorter than the pulse duration, the two echoes overlap — and we cannot tell them apart. But if the separation is large enough that the round-trip time between them is longer than half the pulse duration, we can distinguish the two.\n\nThat’s exactly how we define axial resolution — it’s the distance between surface A and surface B that produces two distinguishable echoes. In symbols, we can write it as:\u000bDelta x equals one-half times pulse duration times c.\nLet me read that again in a smooth way:\u000b“Delta x equals one-half times pulse duration times c.”\nThe one-half factor is there because the sound wave travels a round trip — out to the boundary and then back — so only half of that total distance corresponds to the actual separation between two reflectors.\n\nSo here’s the physical picture:\u000bIf the pulse duration is short, the leading and trailing edges of the pulse are close together, which means the echoes from A and B will be well separated in time — giving you better axial resolution.\u000bIf the pulse duration is long, or if the boundaries are too close, then the echoes will merge together, and you’ll lose that resolution.\nSo when we design ultrasound systems, we try to make the pulse as short as possible — and that’s where the damping material plays a critical role. The damping shortens the pulse, improves temporal separation, and gives us sharper axial resolution.\n\nTo sum it up:\u000bAxial resolution represents the minimum distance between two boundaries along the beam path that can be resolved separately. It depends mainly on pulse duration and the speed of sound in the tissue. The shorter the pulse and the slower the sound, the finer the detail we can see along that direction.\n\nSo just review this figure carefully yourself. Once you visualize how the pulse moves forward, hits surface A, then surface B, and the echoes return, the logic becomes crystal clear. We now have both key ideas of spatial resolution — lateral resolution and axial resolution — and next, we’ll move on to discuss how all this affects image contrast, which determines how clearly structures appear on the ultrasound image.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

The term “contrast” here simply refers to how different tissues appear relative to one another based on the strength of the returning echoes. In ultrasound, acoustic waves interact with different tissues in different ways — and that’s why we see some areas appearing brighter and others darker on the screen.\n\nWe use the prefixes “hyper” and “hypo” to describe this difference in the scattering amplitude of echoes. When a tissue produces echoes that have a higher scattering amplitude than the average, we call it “hyperechoic.” That means the reflected signal is stronger than normal, and it shows up as a bright region on the ultrasound image. Conversely, when the tissue has a lower scattering amplitude than average, we call it “hypoechoic.” In that case, the reflected signal is weaker, and it appears darker on the image.\n\nThese variations in brightness — from hyperechoic to hypoechoic — are what give us contrast. They allow us to distinguish one structure from another. For example, on the ultrasound image shown here, you can see how the liver, renal sinus fat, renal pyramids, and fluid-filled bowel loops all appear with different brightness levels. The renal sinus fat appears bright because it is hyperechoic — it reflects ultrasound strongly. The renal pyramids or fluid-filled bowel loops appear darker because they are hypoechoic — they scatter less energy.\n\nSome tissues, like the liver or renal cortex, tend to have uniform, mid-level echogenicity, meaning they reflect ultrasound in a moderate, consistent way. Others, like the anterior surface of the liver or the anterior surface of the kidney, are more reflective, showing distinct bright boundaries on the image.\n\nSo, in summary — the way ultrasound waves interact with various tissues determines the level of brightness on the image. Hyperechoic areas are brighter and correspond to stronger scatterers. Hypoechoic areas are darker and correspond to weaker scatterers. This difference in signal amplitude is the foundation of contrast in ultrasound imaging.\n\nHowever, sometimes the natural contrast between tissues is not sufficient to clearly separate structures or identify pathology. In such cases, we use contrast agents to improve visibility. One of the most effective types of contrast agents in ultrasound imaging is the microbubble. These microbubbles, typically ranging from two to five micrometers in diameter, are introduced into the bloodstream to enhance contrast. They act as additional reflective surfaces that increase backscattering, especially in regions where the natural contrast is weak.\n\nBy introducing microbubbles, we can significantly improve the visualization of internal structures, making it easier to detect lesions, tumors, or subtle tissue changes. This approach is particularly useful in clinical cases where precise imaging is needed to make accurate diagnoses.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

This shell makes them stable enough to circulate through the bloodstream without immediately collapsing. Their stability can be further enhanced by filling them with a high molecular weight gas, which diffuses out more slowly than regular air.\n\nThese microbubbles are produced outside the human body and then introduced into the bloodstream through an intravenous injection. Once inside the bloodstream, they interact with ultrasound waves. When the ultrasound beam hits them, the microbubbles start to oscillate — they expand and contract in sync with the pressure variations of the sound wave.\n\nBecause the interface between the gas inside the bubble and the surrounding liquid is not acoustically transparent, a strong reflection occurs. This makes microbubbles act as powerful scatterers, producing bright, well-defined echoes. As a result, microvasculature and even small blood vessels become visible on ultrasound images, greatly improving the detection of blood flow and perfusion.\n\nMoreover, these microbubbles can be customized. Scientists can modify the shell using polymers or special coatings that allow the surface to be functionalized with antibodies. When certain antibodies are attached, the microbubbles can specifically bind to biological targets — for example, tumor cells or inflammatory markers.\nWhen that happens, the microbubbles accumulate around those target regions. On the ultrasound image, those regions appear as bright, localized signals — making it possible to identify molecular features, not just structural ones. In other words, microbubbles transform ultrasound from a purely anatomical imaging modality into a molecular and cellular imaging tool.\n\nSo, when you see very bright, clustered signals after microbubble injection, it often indicates the presence of something biologically distinct — such as a tumor. This development marks a major advancement in medical ultrasound, extending it from traditional imaging into targeted diagnostics.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 43}

The idea is both simple and powerful. Suppose we inject a drug together with microbubbles into the bloodstream. These microbubbles circulate throughout the body, including through the small vessels, or microvasculature, around a tumor site.\n\nWhen we know the approximate location of a tumor, we can focus ultrasound waves precisely on that region. The ultrasound energy — tuned to the right amplitude and frequency — causes the microbubbles in that area to oscillate vigorously. If we increase the energy slightly, the bubbles rupture or collapse, releasing their drug payload right at the target site.\n\nThis process delivers the medication directly to the tumor, minimizing side effects and maximizing treatment effectiveness. It’s like having millions of tiny delivery capsules that release the drug only when and where an ultrasound activates them.\n\nThis technique opens the door to an entirely new field known as theranostics — combining therapy and diagnostics. With this approach, ultrasound imaging can both visualize and treat disease simultaneously. The precision and non-invasiveness of this method make it an extremely promising direction for the future, particularly for treating cancers and other localized diseases.\n\nSo, using ultrasound and microbubbles together, we can not only image internal structures in great detail but also control drug delivery dynamically — by sound waves themselves.

Assume that the transducer is damped, and then repeat the plot for the beam returning to the transducer after passing through tissue and being backscattered.\n\nThe second problem, number three point six, focuses on the concept of the matching layer, which is one of the most important topics we covered today. The question is:\u000b“To improve the efficiency of a given transducer, the amount of energy reflected by the skin directly under the transducer must be minimized. A layer of material with an acoustic impedance Z M L is placed between the transducer and the skin. If the acoustic impedance of the skin is denoted by Z S, and that of the transducer crystal is denoted by Z C, show mathematically that the value of Z M L that minimizes the energy of the reflected wave is given by Z M L equals the square root of Z C multiplied by Z S.”\n\nThis derivation is straightforward, and you can find the full explanation in your textbook.

That’s how you build a good memory and a solid foundation. Two ultrasound imaging lectures in a classroom is not enough if you only listen passively. What I’m giving you here is a general yet quick descriptioin of ultrasound imaging methods — and specifically, how we actually form images.\n\nNow, this topic can be divided into two main parts. The first part is about imaging modes. We’ll talk about different types of ultrasound imaging modes — basically, A-mode, B-mode, C-mode, and M-mode, sometimes also called I-mode. What do these mean? Each mode represents a different way of collecting and displaying ultrasound data. There are multiple ideas behind them, and one very important concept that the textbook doesn’t explain in detail — but I believe you really need to know — is called Huygens’ principle. I checked the pronunciation; it’s “Huygens’ principle.” This is a very important physical idea. Understanding this principle will give you a much deeper grasp of how array-based scanning and beam forming work. It shows how you can focus ultrasound beams at different depths and times, giving you tremendous flexibility in image formation.\n\nIn the second part, we’ll move on to Doppler imaging. This part deals with dynamic image formation — it allows us to measure both the speed and the direction of motion, such as blood flow in vessels or motion of the heart chambers. Doppler imaging can be implemented in several ways: you can use continuous ultrasound waves, or you can send out sequences of pulses. It’s a very important imaging mode. We’ll also discuss echo correlation and color Doppler. All these topics are explained clearly in the textbook, so please read that section carefully to strengthen your understanding.\n\nFinally, we’ll look briefly at image artifacts and at some new things — this last part is more for fun and inspiration. We won’t go into all the advanced new ideas in detail. The first three parts — the imaging modes, Huygens’ principle, and Doppler imaging — are what you’ll be tested on. So, let’s begin by asking: what exactly is the A-mode?", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

B stands for brightness. That’s the keyword to remember here. B-mode is a very powerful imaging technique. You can think of it as an extension of A-mode — instead of a single amplitude trace, you’re now using multiple A-mode scans to create a two-dimensional image.\n\nHere’s how it works: in A-mode, you send one ultrasound pulse into the tissue and receive echoes from a single line of depth. In B-mode, you repeat that process at many different positions. You scan line by line — one A-mode here, another next to it, and so on. By combining all these one-dimensional signals, you form a two-dimensional image that shows amplitude, or intensity, as brightness. So, what you finally get is a picture — an intensity map of the internal structures.\n\nYou’re not limited to scanning straight, parallel lines either. Just like in X-ray CT, you can use a fan-beam geometry — instead of sending one beam directly forward, the transducer sweeps across an angle, covering a larger area. This sweeping motion allows you to reconstruct a full cross-sectional view of the tissue. I’ll show you another short movie clip to give you a better visual sense of this process.\n\nNow, let’s look at the movies. First, you see the A-mode. Here — look carefully. The pulse on the right is the ultrasound wave being transmitted into the biological tissue. The blue dots represent backscattered echoes — reflections from different structures inside the tissue. Notice that the same transducer both sends and receives the signal. So, when the pulse goes out, the transducer then listens for the returning echoes.\n\nLet’s play that again. Watch the blue dots — those are the echoes. You can see how they appear as small reflections. The tail of the pulse gets weaker as it travels deeper — that’s where you receive the last few echoes. This gives you a one-dimensional signal profile, which is what we call A-mode.\nNow, look at the next one — this is B-mode scanning. Each line in the image corresponds to one A-mode scan. When you stack many A-mode scans side by side, you form a two-dimensional brightness image. This example shows a phantom scan. You can see the B-mode image — it’s not as crystal clear as a CT or MRI image. There are speckles, some noise, and scattering effects. But you can still recognize the major anatomical structures.\n\nUltrasound transducers are cost-effective, small, and compact — that’s one of their biggest advantages. They can operate at high speed, producing real-time imaging. That’s B-mode scanning — simple, efficient, and very practical for clinical use.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

So, we’ve talked about A-mode and B-mode — now we come to the next one: M-mode. The letter M stands for motion.\nM-mode is very similar to A-mode, but with one important difference. In A-mode, you send a pulse and get one amplitude profile at one point in time. In B-mode, you scan across space — one A-mode line after another — so the difference between two A-mode profiles represents a change in spatial location. You’re scanning across different positions or angles to build an image.\n\nIn M-mode, however, you stay at the same location — the same angle — and you repeatedly collect ultrasound signals over time. So instead of scanning across space, you’re scanning across time. What changes here are the internal structures that move, like the walls of a vessel or a heart chamber.\nFor example, imagine selecting a region of interest, such as part of the heart wall. As the heart beats, that wall expands and contracts. Even though the probe stays fixed, the echoes you receive from that region change over time. Each A-mode measurement gives you a one-dimensional profile, but now, because of motion, those profiles vary with every pulse. Sometimes the wall moves closer to the transducer; other times, it moves away.\n\nIf you keep recording these signals, you can build a motion profile. You can still display it as a two-dimensional image: the vertical axis represents depth — just like a typical A-mode — and the horizontal axis represents time. The result is a real-time record of motion. This is what we call motion mode, or M-mode.\nIt’s especially useful for studying moving organs, such as the beating heart, where you can visualize the rhythmic motion of cardiac walls and other dynamic structures over time.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

You know, three-dimensionally, if you cut a patient with a virtual plane this way, we usually call that the transverse plane. If you cut the patient this way, you call it sagittal. But if you cut the patient this way—think I am facing you and you cut like this—that is called the coronal image. So you have three views. I will show some images.\n\nYou do A-mode imaging along this direction. You have all the information, and the spatial dimension along this direction is your coordinate system—just one axis. But you can do some echo-gated imaging. You send the pulse in that direction, you wait a certain amount of time, then you see—within a small time window—if the echo comes back. Given the delay time, you really target a specific depth. So from this one line, you roughly calculate: the ultrasound goes a round trip from the transducer to the plane and back. Suppose this round-trip time is, for example, 100 microseconds—let’s say 100 milliseconds in my example. You only see the amplitude at 100 microseconds. That is the round-trip echo time—the echo goes here, hits the plane, comes back—so, 100 microseconds.\n\nThis 100-microsecond sample is reported as your pixel value. Then, on this two-dimensional coronal plane, you keep scanning—line by line, pixel by pixel. You make sure the round-trip time is targeted to that depth position. You put all these amplitude values together, and you form a two-dimensional image. That is the so-called coronal image.\n\nHere is an example: you have a hand here. You put the ultrasound into the hand, and you record the echoes. With all the timing coordinated right, you form an internal image that cuts through the hand. You can see certain pieces of bone. There is some terminology I just learned—metacarpals—these light-blue bones; you can see these light-blue bones. The transducer is operated in C-mode here. There are some good ideas; details are in this article.\n\nYou have the image—the image is really formed here. Then the image in a pixel here is reflected by a half-silvered mirror and viewed by the reader or doctor. Through this half-silvered mirror, you see the patient’s body, and the image you see is really superimposed onto the patient’s internal structure. It gives you the illusion that you see into the patient directly—you see the beating heart—and you can maybe use this as guidance to put the catheter there, make a blood vessel open wider.\n\nThis is a good idea. It kind of works with augmented-reality things, and it’s a good idea. But the C-mode has nothing to do with this viewer. C-mode can be understood only with this sub-figure—so that’s the idea. And ultrasound imaging so far is straightforward. I have explained to you A, B, C, M—so you see later, a word you need to remember.\n\nOK, this is a single-crystal–based transducer that can be used to do all these kinds of things. But when you want to form two-dimensional images, you need an easy scan, or you need to do multiple times—so you have a time dimension. With the time dimension, with a single transducer, you can still form two-dimensional images. Certainly, this is quite a lot like pencil-beam X-ray imaging. In the first generation, you have a pencil beam of X-rays and a single detector; you can do a scan. That is very inefficient.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

This will allow you to do parallel data acquisition. Parallel data acquisition is always desirable. And in the case of clinical—I said chiral—scenarios, faster imaging speed will reduce most artifacts and improve the report. So, a lot of good points to make.\n\nThere are many types of ultrasound transducers. You have a linear array; you can use it in different ways. You have this linear phased array. And there is a one-point-five-D array—so this is a one-dimensional array, but you have several one-dimensional rows; the number is not too big. If the number is very big—so the x- and y-directions are kind of symmetric—you have a truly 2-D array.\n\nPhased means each ultrasound pixel—each element—does not fire in the same way. Each pixel you can think of as a source, as a vibrator. You can make a single piezoelectric material vibrate in the way you want. You can control the vibration with electrical signals through the so-called piezoelectric effect—the reaction plane. And once we have a two-dimensional array or a 1.5-D or 1-D array, each pixel—each transducer—can be individually controlled. \n\nWith that individual control, we can freeze—computer.

Then you can define the next line—you just group elements differently. Then you have a neighboring line, line 2, sending ultrasound waves downward. OK. Next instant, you generate line 3. So you have a line of piezoelectric elements; the elements remain, but each time, the first second—you use this part; the second second, you use the second group. You keep doing this.\n\nThe physical effect is that you send one beam here; next, you send another beam. You keep doing A-mode scanning along many lines. But you do the beam scanning to form a B-mode image not by manually changing location or angle—you do it mechanically or electronically. This is very convenient. You have a reform, so you use the acoustic transducer array, and you can perform scanning easily.

This slide is to guide the idea. Once you have this idea clear, the different schemes for ultrasound scanning and beam forming with an array-type ultrasound transducer will become very clear to you. The so-called Huygens’ principle basically says: if you have a source—just a simple example—if you have a point source, it will generate a spherical wave. The wave will keep moving out, and at a certain time, you have a wavefront here.\n\nThink of the ultrasound wave: you have compressions and you have rarefactions. That boundary is the wavefront. The principle suggests that if you decompose the current wavefront into small elements, you get a small element here, a small element there—multiple small elements. Because the wavefield keeps vibrating—like an ultrasound wave—the small volume element keeps getting smaller and bigger, oscillating around a nominal volume; the pressure keeps changing, following a simple sinusoidal curve.\n\nBy this reasoning, if you view things individually, you isolate a small voxel—you see the voxel keep changing, vibrating, oscillating. You can think: OK, this voxel is a single, small, secondary ultrasound source—or for electromagnetic waves, a small secondary source. Treat that element as a source and ask: how do we predict or calculate the next wavefront?\n\nOne way is to solve the original wave equation and follow the whole propagation process. The other way—the Huygens way—is to forget the original source and say: at a given time, the current wavefront—shown here, A to A-prime—can be decomposed into many small segments. Each individual segment is regarded as a secondary small source. Each small source keeps changing, and each small source generates its own small spherical wave. The next wavefront is the superposition of all those secondary spherical waves added together, forming the new wavefront.\n\nSo this is Huygens’ principle. The current wavefront is decomposed into numerous small sources, and the next wavefront is computed from all these secondary sources. In words, we say: any current point on a wavefront is a new source—a secondary source. And all such new secondary sources, collectively, determine the future wavefront. All the subsequently generated waves added together will form the next wavefront. That is the idea.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

You have multiple small secondary sources here. Each source forms a small secondary spherical wave. These waves together—the envelope formed by all these secondary spherical waves added together—form the next wavefront. In this first case, the next wavefront has the same shape as the previous or current wavefront, so a spherical wavefront propagates as a spherical wavefront. That looks right.\n\nIf you have a plane wave propagating forward, the plane wavefront can also be decomposed into sources—A, B, C, D, and so on. Each is a secondary spherical wave. Again, the envelope of all these small spherical waves forms a plane, which is a new wavefront parallel to your current wavefront, parallel to the previous wavefront. That illustrates how a plane wave propagates along one direction—the direction of beam propagation.\n\nNow, if you have a small aperture, the plane wave goes down to the opening. Because you have multiple yellow sources across that aperture, and each yellow source is treated as an individual point source vibrating out sound or light, you observe diffraction. The light or sound will no longer go perfectly straight; it will bend around the edges—turn around, so to speak.\nIf you have two slits, the waves from the two openings will interfere due to phase differences. At some points the two spherical waves—one from here and one from the other opening—will add constructively; at other points they will cancel. If you place a screen there, you will observe bright and dark strips. This is interference.\n\nThe reflection, the refraction, and many old optical or ultrasonic phenomena can be explained similarly. You have a plane wave here; the wave is incident at a surface. At the surface, you again treat it with Huygens’ sources. Depending on the location, this point is hit earlier and its secondary spherical wave is generated in this direction; that point is hit later and its spherical wave has a smaller extent. The envelope will be defined by straight lines—like plane fronts—depending on the speed of sound or light in the two media, the relative speed in the two media. You will see the transmitted beam change direction. The direction change is determined by the relative speeds of the wave in the first and second medium. This explains a lot of wave phenomena—very cool.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

If you have a beam that is focused toward a certain direction, it shines in a specific mode, and you will have a wavefront forming within that blue region. So, what happens to the wave? Essentially, it behaves as if that entire front of energy is moving outward through the medium.\n\nBut here, instead of a continuous wavefront, we use a two-dimensional acoustic transducer to recreate that same wave behavior. In other words, we can replace the natural wavefront with this 2D transducer array. By doing so, we can electronically control each element in the array to operate exactly the way the original wavefront would. This means that the two-dimensional transducer can emulate the same effect as the real wave field.\n\nWith this approach, we can do the same kinds of operations—focusing, scanning, and steering the beam—with great flexibility. As long as each individual transducer element is driven properly, the array can reproduce the correct wave behavior. This is how we visualize and control wave propagation in a precise, programmable way.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

If you fire all the pulses at the same time, all the elements are activated together, and the ultrasound beam travels straight ahead in one direction.\n\nHowever, if you adjust the timing slightly, you can shape the beam. For instance, if you fire elements 1 and 5 a little earlier, as shown on the time axis here, where this point is time zero, and then fire the others with slight delays, you create different wavefronts that add up. At first, two spherical waves are generated from elements 1 and 5. Then, a bit later, elements 2 and 4 emit their waves, and finally, the central element fires last. When all these small wavelets combine, they form a curved wavefront, producing a focused ultrasound field downward, with the focal spot located here.\n\nNow, the distance of this focus—how deep it forms from the transducer surface—depends on the relative time delays between the elements. If you apply the delay more gradually, the focus will form more deeply. By changing the delay pattern, you can also tilt the beam—to the left-hand side or the right-hand side—by linearly shifting the delay across elements. This gives you complete flexibility in how you steer and focus the beam.\n\nThe essential idea here follows Huygens’ principle—each element acts as an individual source, generating its own waveform with a controlled relative phase. By adjusting the phase and timing, you can create different acoustic or optical effects. This is how beam steering and dynamic focusing are achieved in a phased array.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

This allows for electronic focusing and beam steering in both dimensions, giving you precise control over the acoustic field.\n\nSo, in summary, the 2D phased array operates the same way as the 1D version but adds another level of control.

You can make the focus point closer or farther, depending on the time delay and how you drive those circular rings. So you can adjust the focal distance to be small or large.

Imagine you have scatterers located at different positions, labeled E1, E2, and E3. These are the echoes or signals you receive from different points inside the tissue.\n\nOn the receiver side, you receive all these signals and keep guiding or aligning them properly. If you add those signals together—but with individual delays as shown here—you can make them sum coherently. The tall bars in the diagram indicate a larger time delay. Different modulations of these delays determine which echo signal you want to detect.\n\nAt this location, the phase difference between the central element and the peripheral elements will be large, so the relative delay will be large too. You take the signal from the central channel and keep it. Then, you take the signal from the outer element—it takes a longer time for the echo to reach that peripheral element. That longer time becomes the time delay.\n\nYou add all the signals together, each with its own individualized time delay. When the time delays are properly distributed like this, and you add the five signals together, you form a strong echo—for example, for echo one. But if you use a uniform time delay for all, you are focusing to infinity—that’s a remote point. So, by changing the distribution of time delays, you can guide coherent echoes at different depths.\n\nThis is the basic beam-forming idea.

You receive signals mainly from this region of interest. Then, this group of signals can be moved laterally.\nFrom left to right, you perform scanning—line by line—so you get information along each line. When you repeat this line-by-line process, you effectively build up a two-dimensional image.\n\nSo, in summary, with beam forming, you control how the echoes are added together in time, and with scanning, you move the beam position across the field.

You can sweep the ultrasound beam from left to right, and when you perform ultrasound imaging, you can use this sweeping approach to create what we call compound imaging. Using a phased array transducer, you can steer the ultrasound beams toward the left side, collect multiple image lines—each one similar to an A-mode line—and combine them to form a B-mode image over the region of interest. Then, you slightly change the beam angle and sweep across again, this time pointing the beams toward the right side.\n\nWhat you get are multiple images of the same region, each captured from a different angle. When you combine or “add” these images together, you average the results across those angles. The benefit is that the underlying structures—like the organs or tissues—stay consistent across frames, but the speckle noise and random scattering patterns vary from one angle to another. When you sum them together, the random noise cancels out while the consistent features are reinforced, giving you a much smoother, clearer image with reduced artifacts.\n\nSo, this is what we call compound imaging. It’s essentially a noise reduction technique achieved by imaging the same region from multiple directions. The figure here shows how the image looks smoother, with far fewer speckles compared to a single acquisition. This method is similar in principle to noise averaging or multi-angle integration.\n\nIn short, this is another powerful way to perform ultrasound imaging—whether A-mode, B-mode, or C-mode—based on Huygens’ principle and the use of one- or two-dimensional transducer arrays. You can scan, focus, and form images in many flexible ways. So, read the green textbook carefully and make sure you understand these imaging principles.

When the car is moving toward you, the sound waves are compressed, giving you a higher frequency or a sharper tone. When the car moves away, the sound waves are stretched, and you perceive a lower frequency.\n\nIn other words, the perceived frequency depends directly on the relative velocity between the sound source and the observer.

The wall or the moving red blood cells reflect the ultrasound energy back to the transducer.\n\nIf the wall or blood cells were perfectly stationary, the reflected frequency would be exactly the same as the incident frequency. However, since these scatterers are moving, the reflected frequency becomes slightly different. The vertical component of the velocity—represented here as v cos θ—is what contributes to this difference. This component corresponds to the velocity of motion along the ultrasound beam direction.\n\nThe small difference between the transmitted and received frequencies is what we call the Doppler frequency shift.

The diagram is reduced in size, but the principle remains the same. You have motion, an incident frequency, and a reflected frequency. The derivation goes as follows: the frequency reflected by the moving blood cell or boundary is given by Equation 3.40. Here, c is the speed of sound in the tissue, v is the blood flow velocity, θ is the angle between the beam and the direction of motion, and the whole term is divided by λ, the wavelength.\n\nNow, how do we derive this? The idea is straightforward. The wavelength times the frequency gives you the speed of the sound wave, meaning c = f × λ. The term v cos θ represents the velocity component of motion in the direction of the beam. Together, these describe the relative velocity between the transducer and the moving target.\n\nThe incident frequency of the ultrasound is denoted f ᵢ, which equals c divided by λ. The difference between the incident frequency and the reflected frequency is shown in the last equation. This frequency difference, called the Doppler frequency shift, allows you to calculate the velocity component along the beam direction. So, from the measured shift, you can infer how fast the blood or tissue is moving toward or away from the transducer.\n\nThis may not be immediately clear from the formulas, so let’s use a simple cartoon to understand why this Doppler shift happens.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

The transducer sends out ultrasound waves at the speed of c toward a stationary object. In this case, the speed c equals frequency times wavelength. The wavelength is basically how far the wave moves during one vibration. And how many times do you vibrate? That’s the frequency. So, frequency times wavelength equals the speed c.\n\nNow, in one unit of time, in this stationary case, you see four pulses. I should make that plural—four pulses are sent into the object. This is the reference situation. This simple example gives you the baseline idea, and I just drew more examples to make it clearer.\n\nNow, think about the moving situation. I say, when the object is moving, you will see the apparent frequency change. How does that happen? Think about this: let’s say this same stationary object now starts a steady motion toward the transducer. This is just for simplicity. In fact, the object’s motion is also at a certain velocity, denoted v, and the sound itself travels with velocity c.\n\nSo, in one unit of time, the sound will travel a distance c. In that same unit time, you have four pulses sent into the object. But now, in the second case, the object is moving—also with velocity v—so within that same unit time, the moving object will cover a certain distance. Because it covers that distance, if it were stationary, it would have received four pulses. But now, since it moves toward the transducer, those four pulses that were still traveling through space are “caught” or “eaten up” by the moving object.\n\nSo, this object will intercept not just the original four pulses, but also an additional four pulses that were on their way. Altogether, you now have eight pulses entering the object in one unit of time. Let’s assume the object is a perfect reflector.\n\nIn the first case—when the object is stationary—you have four pulses entering, and it will reflect four pulses within that unit time. So, you receive four reflected pulses, and that gives you the same frequency as the transmitted one—no frequency change. The object vibrates four times, and you see four reflected waves per unit time.\n\nBut in the second case—when the object is moving toward the transducer—it takes eight pulses within the same time period. If it is a perfect reflector, those eight pulses are now reflected back within one unit of time. So, the reflected signal contains eight pulses per unit time, meaning the reflected frequency is doubled.\n\nThis is how a moving object changes the reflected frequency. You get a signal reflected back with a higher frequency, and the difference between the stationary and moving cases is the Doppler effect.\n\nSo, this is the idea. Think about this simple diagram, and then review the equations again. If you think about the connection between this cartoon and those equations, you will gain a much better understanding of the formula—especially the one where we talk about the velocity component v times cosine θ.\n\nOnly the portion of the velocity component along the beam direction contributes to the observed frequency shift. That’s the part of motion you can measure as the carrying frequency. The incident frequency is the transmitted one, and the frequency shift—the Doppler shift—is this difference.\nThis normalization factor is simply the speed of sound, c. So, think about it this way: half of the transmitted power goes out, then it comes back after reflection. That’s the basic Doppler imaging process.\n\nDoppler imaging is an important part of the ultrasound chapter. To really understand Doppler imaging, the key is to understand this formula. If you follow the derivation, it might not be totally clear at first, but if you understand this cartoon analogy, you can see how the Doppler frequency shift is generated.\n\nThe same idea applies across all situations. So, follow these formulas systematically. Then you’ll see what’s going on—why there’s a connection between the Doppler frequency shift and the velocity component that you’re measuring along the ultrasound beam direction.\n\nIf the motion is parallel to the beam, the Doppler shift is at its maximum. If the motion is perpendicular to the beam, you cannot measure it. You can only measure the Doppler frequency shift along the beam direction.\n\nThis is a simple idea, but it gives you a very good understanding of what’s happening physically.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

You can use a continuous wave (CW) method, where you keep sending ultrasound waves continuously, or a pulsed wave (PW) method, where you send one pulse at a time—a train of pulses—to measure the Doppler information. Another important technique is echo correlation, where you send one signal, receive it back, then send another signal, and again receive it back. By comparing the relative phase changes through correlation, you can detect motion.\n\nCorrelation tells you how much one signal matches another. In the foundation part, we mentioned the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, which states that if two waveforms are perfectly correlated, they represent the same event at a specific location. When the reflector moves, the correlation pattern shifts, which reveals how much the object has displaced between the two measurements.\n\nYou can also combine Doppler imaging with B-mode imaging. The B-mode provides an anatomical background—essentially, a grayscale structural image. If you have multiple two-dimensional B-mode slices, you can reconstruct a three-dimensional ultrasound volume. On top of this anatomical structure, you can superimpose the velocity distribution obtained from Doppler measurements.\n\nVelocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both amplitude and direction. You can visualize these vectors using color coding. For example, motion in one direction may appear in red, motion in the opposite direction may appear in green, and another perpendicular direction may be shown in blue. The color intensity represents the velocity amplitude. With this color flow encoding, you can visualize the complete velocity field superimposed on the anatomical image. This combined visualization—structural plus velocity—is the essence of Doppler imaging. Now let’s go step by step to see how each method works in practice.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

In continuous wave Doppler, the transducer is divided into two separate parts—one part for transmission and the other for reception. The transmitting part continuously sends ultrasound waves toward the region of interest, while the receiving part continuously collects the reflected signals.\n\nSo, you have a single transducer housing two elements. One is always sending, and the other is always listening. The signal that is sent out has a fixed transmission frequency, while the reflected signal may have a slightly different frequency because of the Doppler shift caused by motion. What you send and what you receive differ slightly in frequency, and that difference directly relates to the motion along the ultrasound beam direction.\nThe region of interest is where the transmitted and received beams overlap. This overlapping region is the sensitive zone from which the Doppler signals are detected. If the reflection occurs outside that overlap, the signal will not be received effectively.\n\nIn summary, continuous wave Doppler requires two separate elements—one for emission and one for detection—because a single element cannot transmit and receive continuously at the same time. So, CW Doppler uses continuous waves for both sending and receiving, providing constant velocity measurement but without specific depth localization.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

You have one signal going in and another signal coming out. The input signal is transmitted at a certain frequency, which we call f-i, while the received signal includes a small Doppler frequency shift, noted as delta-f. So, the frequency of the returning signal becomes f-i plus delta-f. This delta-f can be either positive or negative, depending on whether the target is moving toward or away from the transducer. \n\nUsing digital signal processing, we can compare these two signals. The received signal is multiplied by the reference signal generated by the transmitter, and this multiplication is performed by a circuit called a mixer, which effectively combines the two signals. Mathematically, this creates two components—one at a very high frequency, which is the sum of the two, and one at a much lower frequency, which is their difference.\n\nSince the transmitted frequency f-i is in the high ultrasound range and the Doppler shift delta-f is quite small, we use a low-pass filter to remove the high-frequency component and keep only the low-frequency term that carries the Doppler information. After filtering, the output signal is proportional to A over two times cosine of two-pi times delta-f times t, where A is the amplitude of the signal. This low-frequency signal represents the Doppler shift itself and allows us to estimate the velocity v using the formula you saw earlier: delta-f equals two times f-i times v times cosine theta divided by c. \n\nSo, by measuring delta-f, we can determine how fast the object is moving along the ultrasound beam direction. However, remember that continuous-wave Doppler does not provide depth information. It tells you the velocity but not the exact location of the moving target, because the transducer is transmitting and receiving continuously along the entire beam path. So, continuous-wave Doppler gives accurate velocity data, but without depth resolution.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

In this mode, we do not send ultrasound continuously. Instead, we transmit a series of short pulses — almost like delta functions — separated in time. It’s not exactly a delta function, but it’s very narrow in duration. \n\nSo, at time one, you send out the first pulse into the tissue along the time axis. Then, after receiving the echo back, at time two, you send out the second pulse, and so on. Each pulse travels into the tissue, reflects from structures, and returns to the transducer. The process repeats again and again, one pulse at a time, to measure motion and flow at specific depths within the body.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

You can see how the pulses are sent one after another into the biological tissue. Between each transmitted pulse, there is a fixed time delay. That time interval is the pulse repetition period, and the inverse of that is called the pulse repetition frequency. This repetition rate is an important parameter because it determines how deep your ultrasound can penetrate and how fast you can sample motion.\n\nEach pulse travels into the tissue and produces echoes that return at different times depending on the depth of the reflecting structure. These returning echoes — let’s call them echo one, echo two, echo three — come from slightly different layers or scattering surfaces inside the tissue. If there is no motion, the interval between successive echoes remains the same. But if there is motion — for instance, blood flowing or tissue moving — that spacing changes slightly. By measuring the change in the timing or phase of these echoes, we can estimate velocity.\n\nIn pulsed wave Doppler, we can also target a specific depth, often referred to as the gate depth. This means we can focus the measurement on a particular region of interest within the body. The operator can adjust this gate — make it deeper, shallower, wider, or narrower — to control the resolution and sensitivity of the measurement. By analyzing how the returned echoes shift over time, we can extract information about both motion and flow at that specific location.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

The pulse travels to that target and comes back after a certain time. Suppose it takes exactly one hundred milliseconds for the sound to make the round trip. If we send a second pulse after one second, that second echo will return at the same delay — one hundred milliseconds — if the target hasn’t moved. Both echoes will look identical, because the distance hasn’t changed.\n\nBut now, if that student moves slightly toward us, the second echo will arrive a bit earlier — the return time becomes shorter. The peak of the echo signal shifts forward in time. This small timing change, or phase shift, tells us that motion has occurred. If the target moves rhythmically — for example, the surface is oscillating — the measured signal amplitude will fluctuate up and down around the average line.\n\nWe record this oscillating signal over time and then perform a Fourier transform on it. This mathematical operation converts the time-domain signal into a frequency-domain representation. The resulting frequency shift corresponds to the Doppler frequency, which reflects the motion or velocity of the surface or fluid. Usually, the motion is not perfectly uniform but has some periodic pattern. By analyzing these Doppler frequencies, we can quantify that motion precisely.\n\nSo, this is the basic idea behind pulsed wave Doppler. It’s slightly more complex than continuous wave Doppler, but it has a major advantage — it allows us to measure motion at a specific depth. We’ll look at some examples and waveforms shortly to illustrate how this works in practice.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

Then, at time two, you send the next pulse, and again you wait for the return signal. You keep sending these pulses one after another, in sequence. Each pulse travels into the tissue, interacts with the structures, and returns as a backscattered echo.

Try to pause the state, which means the reflector or surface does not have a\n\nLet’s go a little deeper into how the pulsed wave behaves. Imagine you’re sending a sequence of pulses toward a target that is not moving. You send one pulse, two pulses, three pulses—each time the echo returns with the same amplitude and phase. If you line up all these received echoes at the same gated time instant, they all align perfectly. The phase remains constant, meaning the surface is stationary.\n\nNow, let’s imagine a different case—one where the reflector is moving or oscillating back and forth. In that case, when you line up the received echoes, you’ll notice that their amplitudes and phases change from pulse to pulse. At a fixed gated time instant, the amplitude might be high for the first echo, lower for the second, and different again for the third. When you plot those amplitude values sequentially, they form a sinusoidal curve, representing a cyclic or oscillating motion.\n\nIf the target moves in a steady direction—say, a uniform motion instead of an oscillation—the resulting signal will not be sinusoidal but rather a linear change over time. So, each echo provides a single sampled data point from a given location, and by analyzing how those points evolve over a train of pulses, you can determine the relative motion of the scatterer or reflecting surface.\n\nIn your textbook, you’ll find several formulas that describe this mathematically, but the key idea is quite straightforward. The pulse wave mode works by collecting one data point from each returning echo at a fixed range. If there is no motion, the points stay constant; if there is motion, the points vary in amplitude or phase. By examining those variations, we can determine relative motion, which can then be related back to Doppler frequency and ultimately to velocity. However, if the object moves too fast, the returning echoes can overlap or become aliased, causing artifacts in the signal. This is one of the limits of the pulsed wave Doppler technique.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

You start with a transducer that sends out a pulse of ultrasound and records the entire backscattered signal as a function of time. That gives you a complete waveform, not just a single data point. Then, you send a second pulse, and again you record the returned signal. By the time the second pulse arrives, the scatterers—such as red blood cells—will have moved slightly compared to their original positions.\n\nTo find out how much motion occurred, we compare the two signals using correlation. You look for the time delay, denoted as tau, where the two signals are most similar. This time delay tells you how far the scatterers have moved between the two measurements. When you multiply that tau by the sound speed along the beam direction, you get the relative displacement. From that, you can calculate the velocity or even derive the Doppler frequency if you prefer.\n\nSo, this is the basic idea behind the correlation method—it’s simple but very effective. By comparing the returning waveforms over time, we can accurately measure how fast and in what direction the blood or tissue is moving. This is often used alongside Doppler analysis to enhance motion estimation accuracy.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

The Doppler information can be superimposed directly on the B-mode image. The B-mode gives you the anatomical structure — for example, you can clearly see a large blood vessel here. Once you have that anatomical background, you can add the velocity field on top of it using color coding.\n\nIn color Doppler imaging, the motion is encoded using colors, typically the RGB scheme. Motion toward the transducer is displayed in red, while motion away from the transducer is shown in blue. Sometimes a green component is used to indicate the variance of the signal — that is, how much fluctuation or turbulence there is in the flow. If the blood flow is smooth and uniform, you won’t see much green at all. But if the flow becomes turbulent or irregular, you’ll see more green appearing in the image.\n\nThis color map gives a one-dimensional view of motion — only along the direction of the ultrasound beam. It doesn’t tell you about lateral movement, but it’s very effective for examining flow in vessels. In more advanced cases, you can apply a Fourier transform to the Doppler signal to obtain the velocity distribution, because the motion is not always at a single frequency. Blood flow, for instance, has multiple velocity components due to pulsation and vessel geometry. So, color Doppler provides a dynamic, intuitive way to visualize those variations on top of anatomical images.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

This method provides more detailed information about the range of velocities within a vessel. You can see how the signal amplitude varies over the cardiac cycle — during systole, when the heart contracts, and diastole, when it relaxes. During systole, the flow velocity is higher, which shifts the Doppler frequency upward. During diastole, the flow slows down, so the Doppler shift becomes smaller.\n\nThe result is a spectrum showing how signal amplitude changes with Doppler frequency over time. Each vertical line in the display represents the distribution of frequencies — or velocities — at a given instant. When plotted together, this forms the spectral waveform, which you often see in clinical Doppler displays. By analyzing these patterns, clinicians can assess blood flow speed, direction, and uniformity through the cardiac cycle.\n\nSo, to summarize, Doppler imaging includes several complementary modes: continuous wave, pulsed wave, and correlation methods, along with color and spectral Doppler. Continuous and pulsed modes measure velocity; color Doppler visualizes it; and spectral Doppler reveals its frequency content.

When we deal with very high-frequency ultrasound—ultrasound signals in the megahertz range—the signal amplitude can be extremely small. If we simply record the raw signal amplitude or intensity as it is, without doing any correction, you’ll find that the deeper features inside the tissue appear much weaker than the ones near the surface.\n\nThis happens because of attenuation and wave scattering. As the ultrasound wave travels deeper, part of the energy is absorbed, and part of it is scattered in different directions. Both effects cause the returning signal—the echo—to decay exponentially with depth. Near the surface, the reflected wave is strong, but as you move deeper, the signal strength drops off very quickly. The decay roughly follows an exponential curve.\n\nTo correct for this loss, we apply what’s called time-gain compensation, or TGC. The idea is simple: as the echo arrives later in time—which corresponds to greater depth—you gradually increase the amplification factor. In other words, you boost the gain as a function of depth to counteract the exponential decay. The amplification curve roughly follows the opposite shape of the attenuation curve. When you multiply the received signal by this depth-dependent gain, the resulting image becomes more uniform in brightness.\n\nThis compensation makes the ultrasound image look much better and more interpretable. Without it, the deeper regions would appear dark and faint, while the shallow regions would look overly bright. With TGC, you recover a more balanced image. However, remember that this correction is based on assumptions about tissue homogeneity—it works well when the tissue properties are roughly uniform. In real biological tissue, conditions are not perfectly homogeneous, so the quantitative accuracy is not perfect.\n\nIt’s similar to what happens in CT imaging when we apply beam-hardening correction—we can reduce the artifacts, but it’s never a perfect fix. So, keep in mind that in ultrasound, different echo times correspond to different depths, and the deeper the echo, the stronger the amplification you need to apply. That’s the principle of time-gain compensation.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

In ultrasound imaging, no matter how you modulate the transducer elements — whether you use a one-dimensional or a two-dimensional array, or even a single transducer — you can never create a perfectly straight, narrow beam. Each transducer element generates a spherical wave, and when these waves combine through interference, they form one strong main beam along the principal direction, plus several weaker beams on the sides — these are the side lobes.\n\nPhysically, this happens because we’re dealing with waves, and waves naturally spread out. Even if we adjust the phase and amplitude across the array, we can’t perfectly confine all the energy into a single pencil-thin line. The best we can achieve is a main lobe with high intensity, surrounded by smaller side lobes with lower intensity. If you’ve studied Fourier analysis, this is similar to what happens when you approximate a sharp function — you always get some rippling, known as ringing. Here, the same principle applies to the ultrasound beam.\n\nNow, these side lobes can create misleading signals in the image. For example, if you’re scanning a region with a single bright reflector, the main lobe gives a strong echo at the correct location. But the side lobes can also pick up reflections from off-axis points, which then appear as false echoes in the image — often as smaller or dimmer copies of the real structure. So, you might see multiple bright spots, even though only one real reflector exists. In clinical practice, recognizing this artifact is essential — you may move the transducer slightly to confirm which echo is genuine and which is an artifact.\n\nAnother related effect is reverberation, which happens when echoes bounce back and forth between two reflective surfaces — such as tissue layers or an air-tissue interface. These multiple reflections cause several delayed echoes to appear on the image, even though only one actual surface exists. They appear as repeated, evenly spaced lines, decreasing in intensity with depth. You can see examples of these side lobe patterns and reverberation artifacts in the slide images here. Understanding them helps you identify what’s real and what’s simply an effect of wave interference and multiple reflection.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

One common type is caused by multiple reflections between layers. Imagine sending one ultrasound pulse into a structure like the lung. The wave first reflects from the top surface, giving you the first echo. Some energy penetrates deeper, hits the bottom surface, and reflects. But on its way, that echo may bounce again from the top surface and return once more to the transducer. As a result, even though you sent only one pulse, you detect several echoes arriving at different times. This produces a sequence of repeated bands on the image — very similar to hearing multiple “hellos” echoing in a mountain valley after shouting once.\n\nAnother important artifact is acoustic shadowing. This occurs when a dense object — for instance, a gallstone or kidney stone — strongly reflects or absorbs the ultrasound energy. Because the wave cannot penetrate beyond it, there’s no signal coming from the tissue behind the object. On the image, this appears as a dark region, or “shadow,” extending below the bright reflective surface. You can clearly see this in the figure on the right, where the shadow forms behind a gallstone.\n\nIn the images on this slide, you can see both types of artifacts — reverberation lines appearing as repeated echoes, and acoustic shadowing creating dark regions behind dense materials. Recognizing these patterns is essential for accurate diagnosis. They’re not always errors; sometimes they actually help identify the nature of the structure — for example, confirming the presence of a stone or a metallic implant.

Their research focuses on combining ultrasound and MRI imaging for prostate cancer surgery. The idea is to use MRI before the operation and ultrasound during the operation, so you can merge or “fuse” the information from both modalities.\n\nMRI imaging provides excellent spatial resolution and sensitivity — it can clearly show anatomical and biological details, which makes it ideal for locating the tumor before surgery. However, MRI scanners are very expensive and not cost-effective for real-time surgical use. They also have slow temporal resolution, meaning it takes time to acquire the image. On the other hand, ultrasound imaging is fast, inexpensive, and easy to use in real time, but its spatial resolution and sensitivity are not as high.\n\nBy combining the two, surgeons can perform preoperative MRI imaging to identify the problem, and then, during the operation, use ultrasound as real-time guidance. Through image registration, or fusion, the live ultrasound image can be aligned with the preoperative MRI. This allows the surgeon to visualize the tumor location with both high spatial detail and real-time feedback.

Using these intelligent registration techniques, the alignment quality improves dramatically — for example, in their results, the similarity index increases from about 0.24 to nearly 0.99. That’s a huge improvement.\n\nWith this level of precision, surgeons gain much higher confidence during the procedure, leading to better surgical outcomes. So this hybrid imaging approach — combining MRI’s high spatial resolution with ultrasound’s real-time imaging capability — represents a powerful direction for image-guided surgery.

The idea is shown here. Imagine you inject an animal with contrast agents — in this case, graphene-based microbubbles. Once these microbubbles are introduced, they enhance the ultrasound signal because the presence of microbubbles makes acoustic reflections stronger.\n\nNow, graphene has an interesting property: it can absorb light energy and convert it into heat. So, when you shine near-infrared light pulses onto the tissue, the graphene microbubbles absorb the light and heat up slightly. This heating causes a tiny thermal expansion — the microbubbles expand and contract in response to the pulsed laser. Each laser pulse causes a brief expansion followed by cooling, and this mechanical vibration generates an acoustic wave, much like a sound pulse. These acoustic waves are then detected by an ultrasound transducer.\n\nSo, you can think of the process as a chain: near-infrared excitation leads to graphene absorption, which causes heating and thermal expansion, generating acoustic waves that are picked up by an ultrasonic detector. From these signals, you can construct an image for diagnosis. The advantage is that the contrast is introduced optically, while the detection is done acoustically, giving both sensitivity and depth penetration. In addition, some of these microbubbles can be used for therapeutic applications — for example, targeted drug delivery. There’s a lot of exciting research happening in this area, exploring both diagnostic and therapeutic uses.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

This imaging method can be applied at multiple scales — from single cells and small biological structures to whole animals and even human patients. The remarkable thing is that it combines the strengths of both optical and ultrasound imaging.\n\nPurely optical imaging provides excellent contrast but limited penetration depth — the light scatters too easily, so you can only see shallow structures. Ultrasound, on the other hand, penetrates much deeper and gives good spatial resolution, but the contrast is not as strong because it depends mainly on acoustic properties. When you combine the two in photoacoustic imaging, you get the best of both worlds: strong optical contrast and deeper acoustic penetration.\n\nThis hybrid approach allows researchers to visualize structures ranging from microvasculature to organ-level features, making it a powerful tool for both biological research and clinical applications. It’s a perfect example of how multi-modality imaging can overcome the limitations of individual techniques.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

With this device, we could turn an iPhone into a miniature ultrasound device. Imagine using your phone not just as a communication tool but as a health monitoring instrument. For example, we might use the phone’s screen or back surface as a transducer array to measure things like blood velocity, blood pressure, or even blood sugar.\n\nLet’s consider blood pressure first. Traditionally, blood pressure is measured with a cuff that compresses the vessel, but perhaps we could use Doppler ultrasound principles instead. When blood flows through a vessel, the pressure from the heartbeat changes both the velocity and the cross-sectional area of the vessel. When the pressure is high, the vessel expands; when it’s low, the vessel contracts. The velocity of blood flow also changes accordingly and can be measured. The shape of vessels can be measured as well.\n\nIf we could measure both the velocity (through the Doppler shift) and the vessel wall motion (by detecting the relative distance between the top and bottom surfaces), then, with proper calibration and machine learning, we might estimate blood pressure accurately — just by placing the iPhone over the skin. Over time, the system could learn your personal profile and give real-time blood pressure readings without the discomfort of a cuff. The same principle could even be extended to use an optical sensor for measuring blood sugar related signals, by analyzing light interactions with tissue. These ideas are still pre-mature, but with advances in materials, transducers and sensors, they may become realistic in the future.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

I’m not going to give you any regular homework, but it’s a good time for you to start reviewing or re-reviewing the ultrasound chapter — what I usually call the green chapter. For my classroom teaching, I want to take a moment to share a few thoughts about how traditional classroom learning compares with what we’re trying to do here.\n\nTraditional teaching is often about knowledge transfer. In other words, you’re given a bunch of information — formulas, numbers, and rules — and you’re expected to become familiar with what other people have already done. You learn the steps, you can repeat them, you can reproduce the same results, and you can memorize the equations. There’s nothing wrong with that — it’s still a good foundation. But our goal goes a bit beyond that.\nWhat I really want is to inspire you to have new ideas. To reach that point, you have to truly understand what’s going on beneath the surface. For example, when we studied the Doppler system earlier, I didn’t just want you to memorize the formula. I wanted you to see the reasoning behind it —to connect the physics to what you actually observe. That’s the kind of understanding that helps you innovate. We encourage you not to simply copy what others are doing. Don’t just see a bridge someone has built and make the same bridge again — instead, learn how to design your own. \n\nYou need to create, to innovate, to generate something new. That’s far more important.\nNow, when I talk about reviewing, we still use a closed-book or closed-form style of study. You can use the book, the slides, and the solutions. Even if you don’t understand every detail right away, I want you to read through the green chapter. Learn the concepts, understand the examples, and become familiar with the existing answers. \n\nAt the same time, try to think hard where you can improve or add new functionality, such as iPhone-based possibilities.\nYou need to think beyond memorization — think about problem identification. When you review the material, try to notice how pioneers and earlier researchers identified their problems. How did they get their ideas? How did they use the tools available to them? Even if the textbook doesn’t directly give you an answer, you can always look for more — use Google Scholar, use Web of Science, explore the literature, and ask ChatGPT and other AI models. Learn to find what you need and to solve problems independently.\n\nAnd finally, motivation matters. The traditional way of teaching doesn’t always emphasize new ideas or encourage creativity. But in real research, motivation drives discovery. That’s what I want to underline. So, when you review and study, don’t just focus on memorizing the content — look for the underlying meaning behind it. Try to understand the ideas, the motivation, and the reasoning that led to them.\nSo anyway — that’s all for today. Take some time to reflect, review the green chapter, and start thinking creatively about how you can connect what you’ve learned to new ideas. That’s how innovation really begins.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 45}

This remarkable technology was the first to let us see individual cells and even cell division — truly a revolutionary step in science. In this part, we’ll discuss the basic idea of visible light as a segment of the electromagnetic wave and how it interacts with biological tissues. Understanding these optical and tissue properties gives us the foundation we need for everything that follows.\n\nNext, we’ll move to optical coherence tomography, or OCT. I’ll explain its basic principle — a fascinating concept based on light interference — and show you some of its clinical applications. While optical microscopy dominates biology labs, OCT is widely used in medical settings, especially in eye clinics. These two methods — microscopy and OCT — are the most established optical imaging techniques with real clinical and research impact.\n\nAfter that, we’ll briefly explore diffuse optical imaging, including techniques such as diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS), diffuse optical tomography (DOT), fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), and bioluminescence tomography (BLT). These are powerful research tools for small-animal and molecular imaging, though they are not yet commonly used in hospitals. Finally, we’ll touch on X-ray optical coupling, which includes X-ray luminescence computed tomography (XLCT) and X-ray micro-modulated luminescence tomography (XMLT) — exciting research directions that bridge X-ray and optical techniques.\n\nBecause this lecture stands alone without a textbook chapter, I’ve reorganized the material into a single, coherent story that combines what used to be two separate lectures. Follow along closely — treat this as a guided story rather than a set of isolated facts. At the end, you’ll find a homework question asking you to summarize key ideas like OCT, DOT, and BLT.

We’ve already talked about the shorter wavelengths, such as gamma rays used in nuclear imaging and X-rays used in computed tomography. On the other end, we have radio waves and microwaves, which are much longer and used in applications like MRI and even cooking.\n\nVisible light, however, occupies only a very narrow portion of this vast spectrum. Specifically, it ranges roughly from 400 nanometers to about 1,000 nanometers in wavelength. Within this band, our eyes perceive different colors — violet, blue, green, yellow, and red — depending on the wavelength. You’ve seen this effect when light passes through a prism, spreading into a rainbow of colors.\n\nSome animals can detect wavelengths beyond our range. For example, certain species can see ultraviolet or even X-ray light, as confirmed by electroretinogram studies. Among humans, individual sensitivity also varies, and a small percentage of people are color-blind, perceiving only shades of gray.\n\nFor medical imaging, each modality uses a different part of the spectrum depending on its purpose. In optical imaging, we focus on the portion we can directly see — the visible and near-infrared range. These wavelengths penetrate tissue to a useful depth, making them ideal for studying cells, tissues, and biological processes using light. Understanding this basic physical foundation will help you appreciate how optical imaging works and why it’s such a powerful technique.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

As shown in this diagram, you can see the different behaviors that occur when light reaches the surface of tissue. There’s the incident light, which hits the surface, and part of it gets reflected right away. Some of the light, however, penetrates into the tissue and becomes refracted light. Inside the tissue, that light can undergo scattering — bouncing around in different directions. Some of the scattered photons may come back out, which we call remitted light, while others continue to travel through and emerge as transmitted light.\n\nThese are the basic mechanisms of light–tissue interaction. You can think of them as reflection, scattering, and transmission. When we send a beam of light into a piece of tissue, some of that light just passes straight through, continuing in roughly the same direction — that’s the transmitted portion. The rest is either reflected or scattered randomly. The light intensity that we detect decreases as the beam travels deeper, and that attenuation happens because of two main effects — absorption and scattering.\n\nAbsorption means that some of the light energy is absorbed by the tissue and converted into heat. Scattering, on the other hand, means that photons are deflected from their original path in different directions. Together, absorption and scattering reduce the intensity of the transmitted beam — very much like what happens in X-ray imaging. So, when we think about optical imaging, we’re dealing with these same physical ideas — transmission, absorption, scattering, and reflection — but now in the visible and near-infrared light range, where tissue behaves quite differently.\n\nSo in summary, when you shine light into biological material, part of it is reflected, part of it penetrates and scatters, and part of it is absorbed. The balance among these processes depends on the tissue thickness and optical properties. These interactions are the foundation of optical imaging and determine how deeply light can penetrate and what kind of information we can obtain about biological structures.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

The exact way light scatters depends on the size, shape, and refractive index of those structures. We can actually classify scattering mechanisms based on the relative scale of the structures compared to the wavelength of light. When the structures are much smaller than the wavelength, we call that Rayleigh scattering. When they’re comparable in size to the wavelength, we call that Mie scattering.\n\nI’m not going to dive into the mathematical formulas or the detailed physics behind these mechanisms — that would take us too far. But the key point is this: visible light directly interacts with cellular and molecular features. Every component inside a cell — the membrane, the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes, and so on — all participate in scattering. Depending on their size, each component affects light differently. So the light that comes out of tissue actually carries information about the microstructure inside.\n\nThis is why optical imaging is so biologically informative. It tells us about cells and molecules directly — something that X-rays or gamma rays can’t do. Optical imaging gives us the finest biological resolution among all imaging modalities we have today. The spatial scale of interaction is on the order of micrometers — that’s the cellular scale.\n\nA typical cell is about 10 to 30 micrometers in diameter — that’s 10 to 30 millionths of a meter. Different cell types vary, of course, and within each cell, there’s a huge amount of structure. You have the nucleus, the nucleolus, the chromatin, the mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, many channels and vesicles — all these substructures scatter light differently. Each layer contributes to the complexity of how light behaves in tissue.\n\nYou know, cells are often called the “building blocks of life.” If you open any major journal like Science or Nature, you’ll see that phrase everywhere — and it’s true. Cells form the basic computational and functional units of biological systems. Later, when we talk about machine intelligence, you’ll see how we borrow this idea — we use “neurons” in artificial neural networks to mimic the way biological neurons process information.\n\nSo, to summarize, scattering happens at multiple levels — from whole cells to tiny organelles — and it gives us an incredible amount of information about biological organization. The optical properties vary with each structure, making tissue highly complex but also rich in information. And just as in X-ray imaging, we have concepts like transmission, absorption, fluorescence, and scattering. When all these are considered together, we call the combined attenuation — it’s very similar terminology. So you can see, optical imaging and X-ray imaging share parallel physics, but optical imaging operates at much smaller, biologically relevant scales.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Similarly, in optical imaging, we can have fluorescence in the visible range. Certain biological molecules or engineered proteins can absorb light of one color and emit light of another color with a longer wavelength.\n\nFor example, proteins can be tagged with fluorescent markers. One of the most famous is the green fluorescent protein, or GFP. When you genetically attach GFP to a specific protein — let’s say to liprin or another biomolecule — they form a pair. The biological part represents your target or biomarker, and GFP serves as the fluorescent reporter. When you shine a blue laser light — about 488 nanometers in wavelength — onto this combination, the GFP absorbs the blue light and emits bright green light. So, when you see that green fluorescence, you know where your biomarker is located.\n\nIn other words, by detecting the emitted fluorescence, you can infer the spatial distribution of your biological target. This is the basic principle behind fluorescence imaging. You can even design these proteins so that they target different molecules — for instance, one may emit green, another red, another yellow — allowing you to track multiple biological processes at once. This kind of optical labeling gives you the ability to visualize molecular events inside living systems in real time.\n\nFluorescence is a very powerful concept. It lets us do what we call “bio-design.” Using genetic and bioengineering tools, we can attach different fluorescent proteins — green, pink, red — to different biomolecules. When those molecules move or react inside a cell, we can literally see where and when they act, based on the color of light emitted.\n\nThis work was so groundbreaking that it earned a Nobel Prize, awarded to several researchers from Japan and California who helped develop and refine these fluorescent proteins. With fluorescence imaging, we can observe living biological systems directly — not just fixed samples. We simply illuminate the sample with the appropriate light to excite the fluorescent probe, and then detect the emitted light, which is usually at a longer wavelength. Both the excitation and emission are in the visible range, making it easy to detect and analyze.\n\nSo overall, fluorescence enables us to perform cellular and molecular imaging in a very direct, intuitive way. You can send in light, stimulate the fluorophore, and watch as it emits a different color of light — giving you a real-time window into biological activity. This is the essence of fluorescence, and it forms one of the most important foundations of modern optical imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

So, what exactly is bioluminescence?\u000bYou’ve probably seen it yourself — on a summer night when the air is warm and the grass is glowing here and there with tiny flashing lights. Those little bugs you see flying around with glowing tails — fireflies — are perfect examples of bioluminescent creatures. Or, if you’ve ever been near the ocean at night, sometimes you can see a faint glow in the water — that’s also bioluminescence, produced by microscopic marine organisms.\n\nSo bioluminescence simply means light that is produced by a living organism. It’s very similar in appearance to fluorescence — both involve light emission from certain molecules or proteins — but the mechanism is quite different. In fluorescence, you must first shine an external light, such as a laser or lamp, to excite the molecules, and then they emit light as they relax back to their original energy state. But in bioluminescence, you don’t have to do anything at all. The organism itself produces light through a chemical reaction that happens naturally inside its body. No laser, no excitation source — just spontaneous light emission.\n\nThink of those insects again: they’re not being “shined on” by any light source, yet you can clearly see them glowing green or pink as they fly. That’s bioluminescence — living creatures generating visible light on their own. It’s sometimes called cold light, because it doesn’t involve heat like a light bulb does.\n\nFrom the imaging point of view, this phenomenon is extremely useful. Scientists can isolate the light-emitting proteins from these organisms — the so-called bioluminescent proteins — and then combine them with other target molecules, such as specific genes or cancer markers. When those target genes are expressed in cells, the bioluminescent signal becomes visible. In other words, if a cancer cell expresses a certain gene, it will literally light up — allowing us to observe biological processes directly, inside living tissue.\n\nSo, thanks to optical imaging, we can now visualize biological activity in vivo, meaning within a living organism, in real time. This is a major step forward for modern biomedical research. Bioluminescence, like fluorescence, represents another important form of light–tissue interaction — one where living systems themselves emit light through molecular mechanisms. In the next part, we’ll discuss how we can use these natural light-emitting processes to actually perform imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

I think most of you learned this back in high school, right? Maybe in Physics II, or in your earlier science classes. No? Well, in any case, this is something that every student should know at least conceptually, and if you don’t, that’s perfectly fine — we’ll go through it together now.\n\nSo, here’s the basic idea. When you send in a parallel beam of light into a converging lens, the rays bend, or refract, toward each other and meet at a single point called the focal point. For a diverging lens, it’s the opposite — the rays spread apart after passing through the lens. If you trace those diverging rays backward, they seem to come from a single point on the same side of the lens — that’s the virtual focal point.\n\nNow, how do we actually form an image using these light rays? Let’s think about a simple example. If you have a real object in front of a converging lens, a ray parallel to the optical axis will bend and pass through the focal point on the other side. Another ray that passes through the optical center of the lens continues in a straight line, unchanged in direction. Where those two rays meet, that’s where the image forms. This is what we call ray tracing, and it’s a fundamental rule of geometrical optics.\n\nThe trick to making this work lies in the curvature of the lens surfaces. If you design the curvature properly, you can make all the parallel beams focus precisely at the same point. Usually, we approximate the surface as spherical when the lens is thin — that’s why it’s called the thin lens approximation. So as long as the curvature is correct and the lens is thin, parallel rays will converge or diverge exactly as expected.\n\nThere’s also an important rule here: when a light ray passes through the optical center — the very middle of the lens — its direction does not change. It just goes straight through. That’s one of the key rules for tracing rays. Another important principle is reversibility — light follows the same path backward and forward. So, if a ray travels from the object through the lens to form an image, the light could just as easily travel the opposite way, from that image point back through the lens to the object.\n\nIf you take the time to think about it carefully, this all makes sense geometrically. The symmetry of the two curved surfaces ensures that when a ray passes through the center, the small refraction at one surface is canceled by the opposite refraction at the other, keeping the ray direction unchanged. That’s why it goes straight through without bending. All these properties — convergence, divergence, optical center, and reversibility — together form the essential rules for understanding how lenses create images.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Rule number one says that a ray passing through the center of a lens will not be deflected — it keeps its direction. This happens because the lens is symmetric, and the small amount of bending at one surface is canceled by an equal and opposite bending at the other. So, any ray that goes right through the center remains straight.\n\nRule number two tells us that rays parallel to the optical axis will converge to the focal point on the opposite side after passing through a converging lens, or will appear to come from a focal point on the same side in the case of a diverging lens. And if you reverse the process — sending rays from the focal point through the lens — they’ll come out parallel to the optical axis. This is a beautiful symmetry and is very useful when tracing images.\n\nThen we have rule number three, which extends that idea. Parallel rays entering the lens at different angles all meet at a single focal plane after refraction. This rule also works in reverse. These three rules are the foundation of geometrical optics, and with them, you can quickly predict where and how an image forms.\n\nSo, when you combine these ideas, you can understand how a real image forms with a converging lens — the rays physically meet at a point on the opposite side. For a diverging lens, the rays spread apart, and the image appears to form on the same side as the object — that’s a virtual image. These concepts are very simple once you visualize how the rays travel.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

You can see lenses of different shapes and sizes — convex, concave, cylindrical, plano-convex, biconvex, and so on. Each type has a specific purpose, but all follow the same physical principles of light refraction and focusing.\n\nIf you’re patient enough to spend time studying these lenses, you’ll find that the underlying physics is straightforward and elegant. What’s fascinating is how we can shape these pieces of glass to control light precisely — to focus it, spread it, or redirect it any way we want.\n\nIn fact, working with lenses can be quite enjoyable. When you actually draw ray diagrams and see them align perfectly, it’s like creating a piece of art. In optical labs, researchers and engineers spend a lot of time polishing lenses and adjusting their curvature to make sure light behaves exactly as intended. It’s a combination of science and craftsmanship.\n\nSo, remember — even though the optical principles are simple, mastering them opens up an entire world of imaging technology. Everything from microscopes to cameras to telescopes depends on these very same ideas of ray tracing and lens design.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

It’s really cool. The zoom lens is designed so that by moving certain lens elements back and forth, you can continuously change the focal length. That means you can make the image appear closer or farther away without ever changing the focus on your object.\n\nHere you can see the different lens groups — usually labeled L1, L2, L3 — working together. When the internal lenses move relative to each other, the path of the light rays changes. The blue, yellow, and green paths you see here represent different light rays being bent and refocused as the lenses shift. By doing this, the system can magnify what you’re looking at — that’s the “zoom” part.\n\nSo, as you zoom in, you can magnify small details more and more. You start by seeing larger features, then zoom in again to reveal smaller and smaller structures — down to cellular or even sub-cellular levels, depending on the optical system. The magnifying power increases with each step, allowing you to explore fine details that are invisible to the naked eye.\nThat’s the basic idea behind zoom optics. It’s not just about bringing things closer — it’s about dynamically adjusting magnification while keeping the image in focus. And that ability to continuously zoom while maintaining clarity is one of the most powerful features of modern optical systems, especially in microscopy and photography.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Let me first describe the essential concept. You can see here in the diagram that we start with a laser source — this is our input light. The laser beam is reflected by a semi-transparent mirror, or what we call a beam splitter, and it’s directed downward through a set of lenses that focus the light onto a single tiny spot, known as the focal spot. That blue plane you see here represents the focal plane — the layer of the specimen that’s currently in focus.\n\nNow, of course, light doesn’t only come from that exact focal plane. Some light is reflected or emitted from regions above or below the focal plane — those are the out-of-focus areas. These are shown here as the dotted lines. The genius of the confocal design lies in how it handles these different signals. Only light from the true focal point is allowed to reach the detector. How? There’s a small pinhole aperture placed in front of the detector. This pinhole blocks light coming from out-of-focus regions, allowing only the in-focus light — the sharply focused point — to pass through.\n\nAs a result, the microscope effectively captures light from one small point at a time, dramatically increasing the resolution and contrast of the image. That’s why we call it confocal: there’s a focus point in the illumination path and another in the detection path — both confocal, both matched to the same plane. The effect is that all blurred background light is rejected, giving you an image that’s crisp, clean, and precise.\n\nBut there’s more — because this setup only collects light from one point at a time, we can’t capture a full image in one shot. Instead, the system uses an X-Y scanning device to move the laser spot across the sample, scanning point by point and line by line. Each time, one pixel of data is collected, and after scanning the entire area, you can reconstruct a two-dimensional image. If you then scan multiple focal planes at different depths, you can combine them to form a three-dimensional, volumetric image of the specimen.\n\nThis technique revolutionized optical microscopy. You can think of it as starting from the basic microscope — the magnifying glass we all know — and then taking a major leap forward. Traditional microscopes magnify, but they can’t reject the out-of-focus blur very well. The confocal microscope solves that problem beautifully by adding precision optics and scanning. It’s a milestone in optical imaging, giving us a much higher resolution and clearer view of microscopic structures.\n\nSo, in short, the confocal optical microscope is a powerful tool that combines focused laser illumination, spatial filtering, and precise scanning to achieve incredibly sharp images. It’s one of those designs that feels both simple and brilliant once you understand it — truly a landmark in modern biomedical imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

The technology was so revolutionary that it became one of the most important tools in biological research. It’s amazing to think that this entire concept — scanning one point at a time through a small aperture to reject out-of-focus light — came from an idea developed when its inventor was still a PhD student. It shows how a simple but brilliant idea can completely change the way we see the microscopic world.\n\nEven though the confocal microscope may seem common today, the design is still considered incredibly clever. It’s a perfect example of elegant engineering — combining optical precision with computational reconstruction to produce crisp, high-resolution images of living cells.

This design is intentional because it causes the light traveling inside the core to undergo total internal reflection. Every time the light hits the boundary between the core and cladding, it reflects back in, staying trapped inside the fiber.\n\nThe result is that the light — and the energy it carries — can travel a long distance without significant loss. So, you can think of the optical fiber as a very efficient light guide. It delivers light, or an optical signal, from one point to another with minimal attenuation, even over long distances and through curved paths. It’s a beautiful example of using the laws of physics — in this case, total internal reflection — for practical engineering.\n\nNow, imagine you place this kind of fiber inside the body, say along the heart wall or into a living tissue. The optical fiber can both transmit light and collect light that’s reflected or emitted back from the tissue. In the schematic below, you see a pair of fibers — one for transmitting and one for receiving. The transmitted light excites or illuminates the target region, and the returning signal is collected and carried back through the receiving fiber.\n\nThis setup is the foundation for optical biopsy and miniaturized confocal microscopy. Using fiber optics, we can bring the principles of confocal microscopy directly inside a living organism — even inside a human patient. That means we can perform microscopic imaging in vivo, observing tissues at the cellular level without the need for large or invasive instruments. So optical fibers not only deliver signals; they open the door to new types of medical imaging that can look inside the body in ways that were impossible before.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

That’s what doctors do tens of millions of times every year — they take a tissue sample, send it to the lab, and after several days or even weeks, you finally get the results. It’s a reliable method, but it’s slow, invasive, and can be uncomfortable for the patient.\n\nNow imagine if you could see those same microscopic structures instantly — without ever cutting into the tissue. That’s the idea behind optical biopsy. Instead of using mechanical tools to remove a sample, we use light. You simply insert a tiny, flexible optical fiber, shine light onto the tissue, and collect the reflected or emitted signal. The information is transmitted back through the fiber and processed in real time.\n\nIn other words, you can obtain the same kind of diagnostic information that you would from a traditional biopsy — but noninvasively, and in milliseconds rather than days or weeks. The optical fiber acts as both the light source and the detector, allowing you to see cellular and subcellular details immediately inside the living body.\n\nThis is truly an exciting step toward real-time, in vivo diagnosis. With optical biopsy, you can visualize tissue structure clearly and evaluate whether it’s normal or diseased right at the point of care. And as we’ll see in the next part of this lecture, the next major development in this direction is optical coherence tomography (OCT) — a powerful technique that extends this same concept of optical imaging into three-dimensional, high-resolution tissue visualization.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Optical light simply can’t penetrate very deeply into tissue. For example, if I shine a light on my hand, you can’t see it clearly through the other side. Human tissue isn’t optically transparent, so the light is mostly scattered or absorbed before it can travel far.\n\nOn the other hand, ultrasound penetrates much deeper — several centimeters, even up to tens of meters in other contexts. That’s why it’s such a powerful clinical imaging tool for viewing inside the body. But its resolution is much lower than that of optical methods — typically in the range of hundreds of micrometers.\n\nSo, what about optical coherence tomography (OCT)? OCT sits right in between these two techniques. It offers resolution close to that of confocal microscopy — on the order of a few micrometers — but with a much greater imaging depth, typically a few millimeters. That’s what makes OCT so useful: it bridges the gap between high-resolution optical imaging and deep-penetrating ultrasound.\n\nThese three — ultrasound, confocal microscopy, and OCT — form the most clinically and biologically relevant imaging modalities for soft tissue. They’re not just theoretical; they’re widely used, well-established, and extremely powerful in both research and clinical applications.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

If you’ve been following the flow of this lecture — from optical microscopy to confocal microscopy — OCT is the next logical step. The last two topics in this lecture are more research-oriented, but OCT is something you’ll see everywhere, from biology labs to hospitals.\n\nSo what makes OCT different from the previous techniques? Well, if you think about it physically, traditional or confocal microscopy uses light to illuminate a sample and then collects the reflected or emitted light. But conceptually, it treats light as particles, or photons — bouncing around, scattering, and being absorbed.\n\nIn OCT, we take a different approach. Here, we treat light as a wave — a coherent electromagnetic wave, like a laser beam. This shift in perspective is key. Because once you treat light as a wave, you can use interference — the way waves combine when they meet — to extract incredibly fine details about the structure of the tissue.\n\nThis coherence-based approach allows OCT to perform precision measurements of distance and structure on the order of micrometers — even smaller than the wavelength of light itself. So, if confocal microscopy gives us sharp 2D optical sections, OCT goes further. It lets us measure depth and reconstruct 3D images of tissue layers, much like an optical version of ultrasound.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

This part is some trigonometry stuff, okay? So just follow me step by step. Suppose you have one wave — I’ll call it y one equals a cosine omega t. That’s your first wave. Then you have another wave, same amplitude, but traveling a slightly different optical path. That one is y two equals a cosine omega t plus phi.\nNow, this phi is the phase shift — it tells us how much the second wave is delayed compared to the first one. When these two waves come back together and recombine, they won’t be perfectly in sync anymore. Because the optical paths are different, there’s a small phase difference between them.\n\nNow, when you add these two waves together — that’s what happens inside the OCT interferometer — the total wave is the sum of those two cosine terms. So, mathematically, y equals y one plus y two equals a cosine omega t plus a cosine omega t plus phi.\nNow, we can simplify that using a trigonometric identity. You might remember this one: cos A plus cos B equals two times cosine of A plus B divided by two, multiplied by cosine of A minus B divided by two. So if we apply that to our case, A is omega t, and B is omega t plus phi. Plugging that in, we get this: y equals two a cosine phi over two, times cosine omega t plus phi over two. Let me say that clearly — y equals two a cosine phi over two times cosine omega t plus phi over two.\nNow look — the amplitude of this combined wave depends on phi, the phase difference. That means as phi changes, the amplitude changes. So, a phase change directly changes the amplitude we measure.\n\nNow here’s another important point. In real optical systems, we can’t measure the electric field itself — the light oscillates way too fast, hundreds of trillions of times per second. What we can measure is intensity. And intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude.\nSo let’s take that amplitude — two a cosine phi over two — and square it. That gives us intensity proportional to two times a cosine phi over two squared. Or, in simpler words, I equals four a squared cosine squared phi over two. Let me repeat that slowly so you can hear it clearly — I equals four a squared cosine squared phi over two.\nNow, a squared term is just the reference intensity. We usually call that I naught. So when we replace a squared with I naught, we get the final formula: I equals four I naught cosine squared phi over two. That’s the key relationship. I equals four I naught cosine squared phi over two.\n\nNow, let’s think about what that really means. Even a tiny change in phi — a tiny phase shift — can cause a big change in intensity because of that cosine squared term. If phi equals zero, meaning the two waves are perfectly in phase, the cosine of zero is one, and the intensity is maximum — four times I naught. If phi equals one hundred eighty degrees, meaning the waves are half a wavelength out of phase, the cosine of ninety degrees is zero, and the intensity drops all the way to zero.\nSo, with just a small phase change — half a wavelength — the brightness goes from full to completely dark. That’s interference. That’s how powerful this relationship is. Now, remember, the wavelength of light is extremely small — around four hundred to one thousand nanometers. That means this interference can detect changes in optical path length on the order of nanometers. That’s unbelievably precise.\n\nSo, the big idea here is that a small change in phase produces a measurable change in amplitude — or in the brightness that we detect. That’s the fundamental principle of OCT. And this intensity, I, is modulated by cosine squared phi over two. So as phi changes — from zero to three hundred sixty degrees — the intensity goes from bright to dark and back again. That creates an interference fringe pattern.\n\nThose bright and dark fringes are what we analyze in OCT. Each fringe corresponds to a small change in path length, and by counting or analyzing those fringes, we can calculate the depth with extremely high accuracy — down to micrometers or even nanometers.\n\nSo, remember this equation — I equals four I naught cosine squared phi over two. That’s the one you want to keep in mind. It’s the bridge between phase change and amplitude change. And that’s the beauty of optical coherence — we can’t see the phase directly, but we can measure the amplitude. The change in brightness tells us how the phase has shifted.\nThat’s why OCT is such a precise imaging technique. Two beams — one reference, one sample — recombine, interfere, and the resulting intensity pattern gives us incredibly fine depth information. So again, the simple rule: a small change in phase leads to a measurable change in amplitude. That’s the essence of optical coherence tomography.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Suppose you have coherent light — right light that is coherent means all the waves maintain a fixed phase relationship with one another. This light can include multiple colors or wavelengths — red, orange, green, purple, and so on — each with its own wavelength, lambda one, lambda two, lambda three, and so on. So, when you look at this broadband light, it’s really a mix of many slightly different frequencies that are all still coherent enough to interfere with each other.\n\nNow, imagine this light entering an interferometer setup. The light from the source first hits a beam splitter. This beam splitter is partially transparent, meaning part of the light passes straight through while the rest is reflected upward. That splits the beam into two optical paths. The first beam passes through the splitter, hits a fixed mirror — which is a perfect reflector — bounces back, passes through the beam splitter again, and goes down to the detector. That’s path one. The second beam, the reflected one, travels upward to a movable mirror, also a perfect reflector. It bounces back down, and because the beam splitter is semi-transparent, some of that returning light passes through to the same photodetector. That’s path two.\n\nSo, now you have two optical paths — one fixed, one adjustable — and the light from both paths recombines at the detector. If those two paths are the same length, the two beams arrive perfectly in phase, meaning their peaks and valleys line up. When that happens, they interfere constructively, and the total signal at the detector is at its maximum. But if you move that movable mirror by half a wavelength, the light in one arm travels a little farther, and the two waves arrive completely out of phase — one is at a peak while the other is at a trough. They cancel each other out, and the detector sees zero intensity. So, by moving that mirror just a tiny bit — even by half a wavelength — you can make the signal go from bright to dark. This is the basic principle of interferometric measurement.\n\nMathematically, this is described by the formula we derived earlier, which follows that same “one plus cosine” relationship. The cosine term represents the phase modulation, and the argument of that cosine depends on the difference in optical path length multiplied by the frequency of the light. That product — the path difference times the frequency — gives you the phase angle. So, for a single wavelength, say the red light, the signal can be written as I equals two I naught times one plus cosine of two pi delta L times nu. Now, if you use several wavelengths — orange, green, purple — each will have its own cosine term because each frequency is slightly different.\n\nSince light interference is a linear process, you can add all these contributions together. When you do that, you get a sum of cosine terms, each oscillating at slightly different frequencies. The overall signal, therefore, looks like a modulated waveform — a burst of interference fringes that fade in and out. If you had only one wavelength, you’d see a clean, continuous sine wave pattern of bright and dark fringes. But when you combine multiple wavelengths, the slightly different frequencies cause the waves to occasionally line up and then drift out of phase again. This creates the clustered or “envelope-shaped” interference pattern we often see in broadband interferometry.\n\nSo, the total intensity can be written as gamma of delta L equals two times the sum of I naught i times cosine of two pi delta L times nu i, where the sum is taken over all wavelengths. Each component is modulated by its own cosine term, and when all are added together, they form this envelope pattern. When the mirror is positioned such that all the wavelengths line up, you get strong constructive interference. As you move the mirror further, the wavelengths gradually fall out of phase, and the interference fades away.\n\nThis is the essential idea behind interference of coherent or partially coherent light. Two optical paths — one fixed and one movable — produce an interference signal that varies with the optical path difference. For multiple wavelengths, the pattern becomes modulated and forms an interference envelope. And by analyzing that envelope, you can precisely determine the optical path length difference. This concept forms the foundation for optical coherence tomography, where we use these interference patterns to extract depth information with extremely high precision.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Imagine several sine-wave components of different colors, each slightly different in frequency. When we add them together, the result no longer looks like a clean, single-frequency wave.\n\nInstead, you start to see an envelope pattern — a burst that looks like a Gaussian-shaped profile, or what we often call a coherence envelope. The more components you add — red, orange, green, blue, all slightly shifted — the narrower and sharper that envelope becomes. This figure visually shows exactly that. With two components, you can still see the oscillations clearly. Add three components, and the interference gets tighter. Add seven components, and now the oscillations begin to cluster and fade away at the edges, forming a smooth, localized shape. \n\nSo, if you keep increasing the number of wavelengths, the interference pattern becomes confined in space — like a short pulse — and its overall shape starts resembling a Gaussian curve. That’s the idea behind partial coherence. The more wavelengths you combine, the shorter the coherence length becomes, and the interference fringes appear only within that small region.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Instead of summing over discrete frequency components, we move into a limit where the summation becomes an integral. Each small intensity component contributes a little bit of energy within a narrow frequency band, and when you take the limit, the total becomes an integral over the full frequency range. \n\nMathematically, this looks like gamma of delta L equals two times I naught times the integral of S of nu times cosine of two pi delta L nu, d nu. Here, S of nu represents the power spectrum of the light source, describing how much energy each frequency contributes.\nNow, if this looks familiar, it should — because this integral is nothing but a Fourier transform. You might remember that in a standard Fourier transform, we use an exponential kernel, e to the power of j two pi something, but since cosine is an even function, this is essentially the real part of that transform. So, using only the cosine kernel still gives us the same kind of frequency-to-space relationship. If you were to include sine terms too, you’d have the full complex exponential, but for our optical system, the cosine component is enough.\n\nThis means that what the interferometer is really doing — physically — is performing a Fourier transform of the source spectrum. The detected interference pattern is the cosine transform of the spectral density. So, when you move the mirror and record how the intensity changes, you’re effectively mapping out the coherence function of the light. When the optical path difference matches within the coherence length of the source, you get visible fringes. As soon as you move beyond that range, the interference fades away because the different frequency components go out of sync. That’s why interference fringes are only observed when the two optical paths are matched within that coherence length.\n\nNow, think about how we use that in imaging. As the movable mirror scans back and forth, you collect this varying signal over time. Some parts of the sample are closer, some are deeper, so their reflected signals arrive at slightly different delays. When you record and reconstruct all those depth-dependent interference signals, you essentially form an image — one line of depth at a time. And by stacking those lines together, you can build a full cross-sectional image. That’s the basic principle of how optical coherence tomography captures structure in depth using interference.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

One of the most famous examples is the Michelson Interferometer, which was not just used in imaging but also in fundamental physics experiments. In fact, it played a crucial role in shaping modern physics. The Michelson setup is just what we described — a beam splitter, a fixed mirror, and a movable mirror. Light travels along two paths, reflects back, and the interference pattern tells us how the path lengths differ. The optical path length difference is given by delta L equals two times the difference between L two and L one. The phase difference between the two beams is phi equals two pi delta L divided by lambda. And the detected intensity at the photodetector is given by I equals I one plus I two plus two times the square root of I one times I two times cosine phi.\n\nNow, if the two beams arrive in phase, meaning the optical path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, that gives constructive interference — maximum brightness. Mathematically, that happens when two pi delta L divided by lambda equals two m pi, or simply delta L equals m lambda, where m is an integer — zero, one, two, and so on. But if the path difference equals an odd multiple of half wavelengths — like delta L equals m plus one-half times lambda — then the waves cancel out, producing destructive interference, or darkness at the detector.\n\nWhat’s fascinating is that this same interferometer was used by Michelson and Morley in one of the most famous experiments in physics history. They wanted to test whether the speed of light changes depending on the motion of the Earth — whether it moves through something called the “ether.” The experiment was performed at Case Western University, and at that time, people expected to see a shift in the interference pattern as the apparatus rotated, meaning that light would travel slightly faster in one direction than another. But no shift was observed. The result was completely null. That means the speed of light was constant in all directions, independent of the motion of the source or the observer.\n\nThat single observation changed the world of physics. It showed that light doesn’t behave the way classical mechanics predicted. A few years later, Albert Einstein took that result and built his theory of Special Relativity around it — declaring the speed of light to be constant for all observers. So this simple optical instrument — based on the same interference principles we’ve been discussing — essentially marked the birth of modern physics. The Michelson Interferometer not only explains how OCT works, but also represents the bridge between classical and modern physics.

It’s really the same idea as what we just discussed with the Michelson interferometer, but now applied to imaging. You can see here, we have a light beam that comes from a low-coherence light source — so not a pure single wavelength, but a broadband light with many wavelengths mixed together. This beam first passes through a collimation lens to make the light travel in a parallel direction. Then it reaches the beam splitter, where the light is divided into two paths. One part of the beam goes upward toward the reference mirror, and the other part travels sideways toward the sample under test.\n\nThe light going to the reference mirror bounces back after reflection and returns to the beam splitter. Meanwhile, the light that goes toward the sample also gets reflected — but from within the tissue itself. Think of this like sending the beam into the sample; it penetrates a little, hits various microstructures at different depths, and each layer reflects part of the light back. Those reflected signals travel back toward the beam splitter and are then combined with the reference beam.\n\nNow, depending on the phase difference between the reference signal and the reflected signal from the sample, the two waves interfere either constructively or destructively. This means that at each position — at each depth — the detector receives a slightly different intensity. You measure those variations point by point, and as the reference mirror scans along the axial direction, you record all the interference signals that come from different depths of the sample. Each point corresponds to a small reflection site inside the tissue.\n\nSo what happens next is that these interference signals are detected by the photodetector, digitized, and sent to a computer for processing. One depth scan gives you a one-dimensional line — we call that an A-scan. When you move the beam laterally across the sample — for example, in the x or y direction — you collect many A-scans side by side, building up a full cross-sectional image. That’s the essential idea of optical coherence tomography — measuring optical interference point by point, and reconstructing the internal microstructure of a sample in depth.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

OCT is widely used for retinal examination. Here, you can see a cross-sectional OCT image of a normal human retina. The bright layers represent strong reflections — usually the interfaces between different tissue layers — while the darker regions show areas where light penetrates deeper before scattering. You can see here, the scale bar indicates about 250 micrometers — that’s just one-quarter of a millimeter — so this technique provides incredibly fine resolution.\n\nEach layer of the retina — from the nerve fiber layer at the top to the photoreceptor layer at the bottom — has its own distinct optical properties. Because of this, the reflected interference pattern from each layer is slightly different. By analyzing these interference patterns, OCT can reveal the microstructure of the retina in exquisite detail.\n\nWhat I’ve explained so far is the basic principle, but in practice, it’s a bit more sophisticated. You need laser scanning systems to move the beam precisely, and you use Fourier analysis to extract the depth information from the interference signals. By doing this repeatedly and precisely, you can reconstruct full three-dimensional images of the retina. OCT has become a standard tool in ophthalmology, helping doctors detect and monitor diseases like glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy.\n\nSo, from the same principle we learned earlier — optical interference — you can create a detailed, noninvasive image of the living eye.

Suppose instead of imaging the eye, we use a tiny flexible optical fiber — the same kind of fiber used in telecommunications — and we put it inside the body. That’s exactly what’s done in intravascular OCT for cardiac studies. A miniature OCT probe is built right into a catheter — that’s the small tube used in heart procedures. This fiber can be guided through the blood vessels, all the way to the coronary arteries.\n\nOnce the probe is in place, OCT can scan the inside of the blood vessel, creating high-resolution images of the artery wall. With this, doctors can see if there’s a buildup of plaque, a blood clot, or any kind of blockage. They can even distinguish between different types of plaque — for example, whether it’s hard and calcified or soft and lipid-rich. This distinction is extremely important because soft, unstable plaques are the ones most likely to rupture and cause a heart attack.\n\nSo, using OCT, clinicians can visualize the inside of the heart’s arteries in real time, with microscopic precision — something that traditional imaging methods like X-ray angiography can’t show. It’s minimally invasive, it’s fast, and it provides information that’s both structural and functional.\n\nYou can think of this as doing an “optical biopsy” inside the blood vessel — without removing any tissue. This is why OCT has become such a powerful tool, not only in ophthalmology but also in cardiology and other clinical applications.

We’ve wrapped up the second part, and now we’ll continue into the third and fourth parts. In the first part I walked you through the key ideas. We talked about optical microscopy and the confocal idea — a wonderful idea. No Nobel Prize there, unlike OCT, but still pretty amazing. Then we looked at how interference lets you do imaging — not only optical coherence tomography, but interferometric imaging in general. The principle itself is profound, even when there isn’t a Nobel attached to it.\n\nYou may have read the news about gravitational wave detection. How do they detect those waves? The waves create tiny vibrations — unbelievably small — that you would think are impossible to measure. The trick is interferometry. Two long arms, miles long, two optical paths that pick up a minute difference, and that difference is magnified by interference. There are setups in the United States and Europe, and even programs in China. Some people are pushing to use satellites to make the arms even longer. Interferometry is incredibly helpful whenever you have wave behavior and you want extremely precise measurements.\n\nSo the two ideas — confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography — sit inside this larger family of interferometric imaging. It’s not only optical; X-rays and even gravitational wave observatories use the same core idea. In the end, it all goes back to adding waves: cosine omega t plus cosine omega t plus phi. That simple concept has powered multiple Nobel-level advances. Now, let’s turn to something different: diffuse optical imaging.

These third and fourth parts aren’t in common clinical use yet, but in research settings, they’re very active. With X-ray imaging, rays go essentially straight. Think of that purple straight line: the signal is a line integral along the path. Everything contributes additively, and you can explain it with the linear attenuation coefficient along that ray. Any change in the measurement must come from features located along that ray — that’s a strong localization claim, and it’s very clear.\n\nOptical imaging is different. Biological tissue scatters light strongly. I showed you that little cartoon of scattering — Rayleigh at small scales, Mie at larger ones — and you’ve all seen this in real life. In a dark room, shine a bright laser pointer and you see a diffuse glow. Put the laser behind your finger: can you see details behind the finger? No. With X-ray, the projection already looks like a picture. With optical light, even if you send a parallel laser beam, what you see is a cloudy smear. And yet, diffuse optical imaging says, despite that strong scattering, we still want to reconstruct an image.\n\nSo put it in simple words: we want to make a good image behind the finger. That sounds almost impossible, and it is hard. That’s why diffuse optical imaging is not as practical as X-ray and some other modalities. But optical interactions carry rich biological information, so we study them. Our job as engineers is to turn “impossible” into “feasible.” That’s the challenge — and that’s why we dig into diffusion models and inverse problems to see what can be recovered.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

We decompose a piece of heterogeneous tissue into many small elements — in three dimensions, these are typically tetrahedra — and we assume each small element is uniform. Then we launch photons into the mesh and watch what happens.\n\nWhen a photon hits a boundary where optical properties change, it can reflect or transmit, with angles set by the physics. Once inside a region, it travels some distance, then scatters; all of these events are probabilistic. We use random number generators — this is the dice-rolling part — to decide whether a step reflects or transmits, how far the photon goes before the next interaction, and in what direction it scatters. We trace one photon step by step: maybe it reflects, maybe it refracts, maybe it travels, scatters, and then gets absorbed — good news and bad news, if it’s absorbed, you’re done with that photon. Or it might exit the tissue and reach a detector.\n\nThat’s the story for a single photon. Then you launch another photon. And another. You keep going — millions, even billions of photons — to build up statistics. This Monte Carlo approach lets you model refraction, reflection, scattering, absorption, and escape to the detector, all according to the measured or assumed light–tissue interaction properties. From those simulated detections, you can predict measurements and eventually tackle the inverse problem of forming an image in highly scattering tissue.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

In our lab, we once developed one of the fastest numerical simulators of its kind — it’s called a tetrahedron-based, inhomogeneous Monte Carlo optical simulator. Quite a mouthful, right? But what it really means is that we used a mesh made of small tetrahedral elements to simulate photon transport in realistic biological tissue.\n\nHere, you see a simulated mouse model. It’s not just a cartoon — it’s a detailed anatomical mesh. You can see the heart, lungs, liver, stomach, spleen, and kidneys, all represented as separate organs with different optical properties. We place a small bioluminescent light source — say, something glowing inside the mouse — and then we let it emit photons. Those photons scatter through the tissue, and our simulator tracks where they go and how much light reaches the surface.\n\nOn the right, you can see the simulated fluence maps, color-coded to show photon density. The color bar on the side tells you how strong the signal is — from deep blue, meaning very few photons, up through green, yellow, and bright red, meaning a high photon density. It’s quite beautiful when you think about it: millions of photons bouncing, scattering, being absorbed — and yet out of all that chaos, you can reconstruct where the light came from inside the body.\n\nThis simulator was developed in our group, and I’m proud to say this work has become foundational. In fact, my former student, Qing-Sung, who worked on this, recently got a fantastic offer from Google to continue research in machine learning.

When light enters tissue, it doesn’t travel far before it gets scattered, because the medium is highly scattering. Statistically, we describe this using something called the mean free path. The mean free path is the average distance a photon travels before being scattered. For biological tissue, that’s typically on the order of one-tenth of a millimeter — a very short distance.\n\nBelow that distance, we say the photons are in the ballistic region — they travel almost straight, like X-rays, without scattering much. But once they start scattering, things get complicated. The direction changes slightly with each scattering event, and after several scatterings, the photon is completely randomized.\n\nThat’s why X-ray imaging works so well — the X-rays go straight, so you know exactly which direction they came from. But in optical imaging, photons quickly lose that directional information. You detect a photon, but you can’t tell whether it came directly from your target or if it was scattered off several other structures first. It’s like hearing an echo in a cave — you know sound reached you, but you don’t know exactly from where.\n\nTo describe this loss of directionality, we use another parameter called the transport mean free path. After traveling one transport mean free path, the photon’s direction has essentially been randomized — it has lost all memory of where it came from. In typical biological tissue, this distance is about one millimeter.\n\nThat means that within the first millimeter, you can still recover some useful information — that’s where diffuse optical imaging and near-infrared spectroscopy operate. But beyond that depth, it becomes extremely challenging. You lose the ability to form high-resolution images because photons have wandered too much. It’s not totally impossible, but it’s very hard. That’s one of the fundamental physical limits of optical imaging.\n\nSo to summarize: photons in tissue move only about a tenth of a millimeter before scattering, and after about a millimeter, their paths are completely randomized. That’s why optical imaging is powerful for shallow structures — like the cortex, or the retina — but much more difficult for deep tissue imaging. Later, we’ll see how researchers combine optics with X-rays to overcome that limitation.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

And yes, I know what some of you are thinking — DOS sounds like the old computer operating system. If you remember that, you’re not that young! But in this case, DOS stands for something different — diffuse optical spectroscopy.\nHere, we’re not trying to make an image. Instead, we’re doing spectral analysis — we shine light in, we collect what comes out, and we analyze the overall absorption and scattering to learn about the tissue’s composition.\n\nImagine my finger here. If I shine a broadband light — that means light with many colors — through my finger, different wavelengths will be absorbed differently. Blue light, for instance, is absorbed more strongly than red, which is why your finger looks red when you shine a flashlight through it.\n\nNow, by measuring how much light gets through at two or more wavelengths, we can solve for unknowns in the tissue. Usually, the main absorber in tissue is blood, and in blood, the key molecules are hemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin — that’s hemoglobin with oxygen bound to it. The ratio between those two forms gives us oxygen saturation, which is one of the most important physiological parameters for life.\n\nMathematically, it’s quite straightforward. The transmitted intensity follows Beer’s law — I equals I naught times e to the power of minus mu-a times L, where mu-a is the absorption coefficient and L is the path length. The absorption coefficient depends on how much hemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin are present and how strongly each absorbs light at that wavelength. By measuring intensity at two wavelengths, we can solve for two unknowns — the concentrations of Hb and HbO₂.\n\nIn fact, this is exactly the principle used in a pulse oximeter — that little clip you put on your finger in the hospital. It shines red and infrared light through your finger, measures how much of each gets through, and calculates oxygen saturation using this model.\n\nSo, this is diffuse optical spectroscopy. It doesn’t form an image, but it gives us valuable quantitative information — blood oxygen levels, water content, and even tissue metabolism. In a sense, it’s the simplest and most practical use of optical interaction with tissue — turning light absorption into a window on physiology. And the best part? It’s completely noninvasive — just light in, light out, and a bit of math in between.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

We want to do tomography. We really want to do tomography — just like we do X-ray tomography. So, let’s think about how we actually do X-ray or gamma-ray tomography.\nIn those systems, you send a pencil beam — a narrow, collimated beam — straight through the object. What you measure is basically a line integral. For nuclear imaging, it’s sometimes a quasi-line integral because the photons are affected by an attenuation kernel, but fundamentally, the information you get comes from along that single line.\n\nSo, you get one line-integral measurement, and that becomes one linear system equation. In that equation, all the unknowns — those pixel or voxel values — are weighted according to how much of the beam passes through each small region. That weighting is the fraction of the path that cuts through each voxel. So, mathematically, it’s like this: one unknown times its weighting factor, plus another unknown times its weighting factor, plus another, and so on — all along that beam line. That gives you one linear equation.\nNow you can see how this builds up. You have many, many linear equations — one for each ray, one for each angle. The weighting factors are all known because they come from the imaging geometry — the way you arrange your source and detector. The only unknowns are all those mu values — the attenuation coefficients inside each pixel or voxel — which we call mu one, mu two, mu three, and so on.\n\nNow, how does this relate to the Beer–Lambert law? Let’s go back to that. You have an incoming intensity, called I naught, and you measure an outgoing intensity, I. According to Beer’s law, the transmitted intensity equals the input intensity multiplied by e to the power of negative mu times delta, where mu is the attenuation coefficient, and delta is the distance through that small region.\nSo, suppose the beam passes through one region with attenuation mu one and thickness delta one, then into a second region with mu two and thickness delta two, and so on. After the first region, the output of that layer becomes the input for the next. Multiply all those together, and inside the exponential, you get the total, negative the sum of mu times delta over all the layers.\n\nSo mathematically, we say I equals I naught times e to the power of minus the sum of mu times delta. That’s what we measure. Now, if we take the natural logarithm of both sides, it becomes linear. Log of I naught over I equals the sum of mu times delta. That’s the key point: each measurement gives you one linear equation in the unknown mu values.\nAll the geometry — those delta distances — are known, and the intensities I and I naught are measured. So that’s how we form the reconstruction problem for tomography.\nNow, this all works nicely for X-ray imaging, where photons travel in straight lines. But in optical tomography, things are very different. When we send optical light into biological tissue, we still have all those local attenuation coefficients, all those mu’s — but the light doesn’t travel straight. It scatters everywhere. So we can’t just send one clean laser beam, measure on the other side, and call that a line integral. The light spreads out in all directions, taking many different paths.\n\nEach measurement still has weighting factors, but now those weighting factors are far more complicated because the light is diffusing rather than traveling straight. And when we add up all those equations, they still look linear in the unknown mu’s, but all the equations start to look very similar to one another. That’s the main problem.\nIt’s like this: suppose you have three unknowns — x, y, and z. And all your equations look like x plus y plus z equals one. Then the next one says x plus y plus z equals one point zero zero one. Then another says x plus y plus z equals zero point nine nine nine. You have a lot of measurements, yes, but they’re almost identical. You can’t solve for x, y, and z because the equations don’t give you independent information.\n\nIn tomography, we call that an ill-posed problem. You have a lot of data, but not enough unique or independent information to get a stable solution.\nSo the analogy here is that in optical tomography, all the light measurements look very similar because scattering smears out the information. Each detector sees a blurred, mixed-up version of everything inside. The equations are still linear — yes, still linear — but they’re all nearly the same, so it becomes very difficult to separate one unknown from another.\nAnd that’s the essence of the challenge. Too much diffusion means too little unique information. That’s why optical tomography is so difficult. It’s mathematically ill-posed, physically diffusive, and highly sensitive to noise. The principle is beautiful, but the reconstruction is tricky.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

They keep trying. And they’ve managed to make progress using infrared light, because infrared wavelengths are longer and scatter less than visible light. That gives you better penetration into tissue. So you can still get a measurable signal, even from deeper layers. And then, using some clever mathematical tricks, you can try to recover the internal absorption and scattering distribution — the actual optical properties inside the tissue.\n\nNow, think about how useful that could be. Suppose you have a tumor. In that region, the absorption and scattering characteristics will be different from the surrounding healthy tissue. Water content, fat content, and hemoglobin concentration — all these change when tissue becomes cancerous. For example, cancerous tissue tends to have more hemoglobin, because tumors grow new blood vessels to feed themselves — we call that angiogenesis. So, in optical terms, the tumor region is “hemoglobin-rich.”\n\nSo, people have written many papers using this principle. Under certain experimental conditions, the results do make sense — the reconstructed maps of hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation often agree with what’s seen in pathology. You might see a region with higher hemoglobin absorption — that’s where the tumor is. It’s exciting work. But the question remains: has it reached clinical use? Not really — at least, not yet.\n\nAfter many years of research, diffuse optical tomography is still not mature. The principle is solid, the physics is beautiful, but the system is what we call ill-posed — the solutions are unstable, sensitive to noise, and dependent on assumptions. It’s just not as robust or reliable as X-ray imaging.\nAnd that’s an important comparison. We’re all very proud of our X-ray imaging technology. Every hospital depends on it — CT, fluoroscopy, mammography — they’re all part of daily clinical life. If you took X-ray imaging away from a hospital, they’d practically have to close their doors! It’s that critical. So when you ask a doctor, “If you could only keep one imaging modality in your clinic, which would it be?” — none of them will pick optical imaging. \n\nThey’ll all say, “We’ll keep X-ray.” That’s the truth.\nSo, yes — optical tomography is very interesting. It’s innovative, and it provides functional and molecular information that X-rays can’t. But it’s still a research tool. X-rays, on the other hand, are robust, quantitative, and universally trusted in clinical medicine. That’s where we stand today.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

The idea is very clever. You see, when photons travel through tissue, they go all over the place — scattering in every direction. But if we can measure when each photon arrives, and only collect the ones that arrive early, we can get a much cleaner signal.\n\nFor optical signals, the temporal resolution — that is, the time resolution — of modern detectors is extremely good. So we can actually do this kind of time gating. Temporal gating simply means we only collect the photons that arrive first, before they have time to bounce around and scatter too much.\nIn other words, those early-arriving photons are the ones that have traveled almost straight through, or maybe with just a few scatterings — not too many. So by keeping only those early photons, we’re kind of reconstructing a straighter path through the tissue. This gives us a better localized image and sharper information. That’s the essence of temporal gating — a brilliant idea to improve spatial resolution in optical imaging.\n\nNow, you can think of this as a kind of collimation mechanism. Earlier, we talked about mechanical collimation, where you physically restrict the beam using a tube — that’s what we use in X-ray systems. I jokingly said, It’s my 'technical way' of collimation — you just put a tube in front of the detector so only straight rays go through.\nAnd then we also mentioned electronic collimation, which you might remember from the pattern-imaging systems or coincidence detection in nuclear imaging. There, you don’t use a physical tube — you use timing electronics, or coincidence circuits, to select only the photons coming from the right direction.\nNow here, temporal gating plays a similar role — but for light. Instead of a physical or electronic filter, we use time as the filter. We only accept photons that arrive early enough, meaning those that haven’t wandered too much. That’s why I call it a “temporal collimation” mechanism.\n\nAnd remember, I also mentioned, a while ago, that you can do something similar with polarized radiation? In that case, we used a magnetic collimation trick — flipping the spin of particles back and forth to control their direction, kind of “cheating” to get the same effect.\n\nAnyway, the big picture is this: optical imaging is not easy. It’s still a very active research topic. Even now — well, I think maybe early this year, or perhaps late last year — my group published a paper about improving optical tomography using advanced computational techniques. So we’re making progress. But I must say, it’s still far from routine clinical use. It’s fascinating physics and engineering, but not yet something you’d see in a hospital every day.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging are both very important tools, because they allow us to use fluorescent or luminescent probes to label biological molecules — like proteins, genes, or even drugs — so we can track them in real time.\nMost of the time, we use small animal models for this. Small animals — mice, rats — are used to model almost all kinds of human diseases. We don’t want to experiment directly on humans, of course, so we test our ideas on these animals first. We give them certain diseases — cancer, bone degeneration, inflammation, all sorts of things — and then we test how treatments work.\n\nOnce the biological principles look promising, we test drugs on these animal models to see if they behave as expected before we move on to human trials.\nSo, for example, suppose we label cancer cells with a red fluorescent protein. Then we label a drug molecule — maybe an antibody or some therapeutic compound — with a green fluorescent marker. Now, if the green-labeled drug binds to the red-labeled cancer cells, that means the drug has successfully targeted the tumor. In that case, the red signal would decrease or disappear, and we could monitor that process in vivo, meaning inside the living animal, in real time.\n\nThat’s the beauty of fluorescence molecular tomography — we can visualize biological processes directly, without opening the body.\nNow, if you look at the illustration here, you see the setup. The animal is standing upright, which is not really a physiological position — ideally, the animal should be lying down to minimize stress. But this figure is just to show the principle of the system.\n\nInside the animal, suppose both the cancer cells and the drug molecules are labeled with different fluorescent proteins — maybe blue, green, yellow, or red, depending on what we want to track. At first, you might not see any fluorescence signal on the surface. But then, we shine in a femtosecond laser beam — that’s an extremely short, high-intensity pulse of light — at a specific wavelength. That excites the fluorescent molecules inside the body.\n\nThose molecules then emit light at longer wavelengths — that’s the fluorescence emission. We collect those emission signals using an optical detector, usually a highly sensitive ICCD camera — that’s an intensified charge-coupled device.\nNow, the emission filter plays a very important role. It blocks the excitation light — the laser light that we sent in — and only allows the emitted fluorescent light to pass through. This way, we measure only the signal that comes from the fluorescence, not the original illumination beam.\nSo, in the end, you get a set of projection views — one from each rotation angle — just like a CT scan. You rotate the animal, collect data from multiple views, and reconstruct a 3D distribution of fluorescent activity inside the body.\n\nOf course, it’s not as straightforward as CT, because light in tissue is highly scattered, so the reconstruction problem is much harder — not very stable, not very unique, and sensitive to noise. But still, you can get useful information by combining advanced algorithms and multiple measurements.\nSo this system — using a femtosecond laser, a rotating stage, and an ICCD detector — is an example of fluorescence molecular tomography in small animals. It’s a powerful tool for biological and pharmaceutical research, allowing us to visualize how drugs move, how genes express, and how diseases progress — all in a living system.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

You can see the image of the animal here — this is usually a mouse, and we’ve done the imaging after injecting fluorescent probes. So, you collect the signals from different views, and then you reconstruct a 3D distribution of those fluorescent signals inside the body.\n\nNow, some research groups — and I’ve seen quite a few papers like this — claim that they can do very high-quality reconstruction. And yes, to a certain degree, they can. These results look pretty good, and they do show useful biological information. But, to be honest, the results are still not very reliable yet. The reconstruction quality is limited by noise, by the scattering of light, and by how well the model matches the real tissue.\n\nIf you look at this picture, you can see the 3D reconstructed image with color bars on the right side. The colors correspond to different levels of fluorescent intensity. So, when you look at the image, you get a sense of where the fluorescent probe has accumulated inside the animal’s body. This helps identify regions of biological activity — for example, where a particular enzyme is expressed, or where a drug is localized.\nThis example shows a three-dimensional reconstruction of fluorescence molecular tomography — FMT. So, yes, it’s a practical imaging modality, and it really works, but it’s not for human use. There are a few reasons for that.\n\nFirst, most of the fluorescent probes used in small-animal imaging are not safe for human use — they’re either toxic or not approved for clinical injection. Second, there’s a size issue — humans are much bigger than mice, and optical light simply cannot penetrate that deeply into human tissue. The penetration depth of laser light is very limited.\nSo, for now, FMT is mainly a preclinical imaging technique — something that’s used in research, mostly for small animals. It’s great for drug development, molecular biology, and early disease studies, but not yet practical for clinical imaging in humans.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

I had laboratories on both campuses. And one of the major projects we worked on — a multi-million-dollar project — was about using optical molecular tomography to monitor blood vessel growth.\nLet me explain the motivation behind it. When someone has cardiovascular disease, part of a blood vessel can get blocked — completely closed off by plaque buildup. Right now, the standard treatment is to insert a stent to reopen the vessel and restore blood flow. But as you know, stents come with their own problems — they can cause inflammation, thrombosis, and sometimes even re-narrowing of the artery over time.\n\nSo, the future solution that people are exploring is regenerative medicine — to actually grow a new biological blood vessel from your own stem cells. The idea is that we can take a small segment of your blood vessel, or even some of your cells, and grow a new vessel in the lab — a fully biological, living blood vessel that can eventually be implanted back into your body.\n\nTo do this, we use something called a bioreactor — a special device that maintains controlled conditions for growing tissue. Inside the bioreactor, you have this new blood vessel growing while nutrient-rich liquid continuously circulates it, simulating what happens inside the body.\nNow, the question is — how do you monitor this growth process without destroying the tissue? That’s where our imaging technology comes in.\nWe use OCT, or Optical Coherence Tomography, to capture the structural information — basically, the microscopic anatomy of the growing vessel. You can actually see the layers, the texture, and the thickness of the vessel wall.\n\nThen we combine that with fluorescence imaging to observe what’s happening at the cellular and molecular level. For example, using fluorescence probes, we can track whether endothelial cells — the cells that form the inner lining of blood vessels — are growing properly. That’s critical because without a strong endothelial layer, the vessel won’t be functional or stable.\nSo, in our project, we integrated all these optical methods — OCT for structure, diffuse optical tomography for optical property recovery, and fluorescence tomography for molecular activity — all working together.\n\nThe advantage is that once you know both the structure and the optical properties of the tissue, you can use that information as a prior to improve the accuracy of fluorescence tomography. That means the reconstruction becomes more stable, more accurate, and better localized.\nAnd since these vessels are much smaller than an entire small animal — just a few millimeters in diameter — the light can penetrate through them more easily. So we can actually achieve better resolution and depth information.\n\nThis whole system, combining multi-probe and multi-modal optical molecular tomography, was designed for regenerative medicine — specifically, to visualize and monitor bioengineered blood vessels both in the bioreactor and after implantation into living animals.\nSo that’s what we did a number of years ago — a collaboration between my lab and my colleague, Dr. Shay Soker. It was supported by the NIH R01 BRP grant HL098912, running from 2010 to 2014. And that’s a really good example of how optical molecular imaging can move beyond small-animal studies toward real applications in regenerative medicine — imaging living tissue as it grows, heals, and integrates into the body.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

It’s one of the most fascinating — but also one of the most challenging — tomography problems we can deal with.\nLet me explain why.\nIn fluorescence tomography, you can send in a laser beam — you control where it goes, you can illuminate the tissue from different directions, and that makes it what we call an active imaging modality. You actively excite the fluorescent molecules, and they emit light back, which you can detect and reconstruct into an image.\n\nBut bioluminescence tomography is totally different. Here, the light comes from inside the animal itself — not from any external laser. You don’t get to shine a laser and choose where to excite. The light is produced biologically, inside the tissue, by a chemical reaction, typically involving something like luciferase, the same enzyme that makes a firefly glow.\nSo, imagine you genetically modify an animal — usually a mouse — to express this bioluminescent probe inside its cells. The animal literally becomes like a little living firefly. When the probe reacts inside its body, it emits light that escapes through the tissue, and you can capture that light on the surface.\n\nThat’s beautiful to watch — I still remember when we did this experiment back at the University of Iowa. We worked in a completely dark room, and when the mice began to glow faintly, you could actually see the light coming through their skin. It was really amazing.\nBut scientifically, this is very challenging, because you can’t control the direction of illumination — there is no external laser input. All you can do is measure the light that escapes to the surface. That makes it a purely passive imaging problem, and therefore much harder than fluorescence tomography.\nSo, the question is: can we reconstruct where the bioluminescent light is coming from inside the animal, based only on what we observe on the surface? That’s the big challenge of bioluminescence tomography.\n\nWhen I was at Iowa, we actually got a multi-million-dollar NIH grant to tackle exactly this problem. My idea was to use a multi-modality approach — to combine optical imaging with micro-CT or micro-MRI so we could obtain both the anatomical structure and the optical measurements together.\nHere’s how it works. First, we perform a micro-CT or micro-MRI scan of the animal. That gives us very detailed anatomical information — we can segment the bones, the organs, the tissue layers. We then take that structure and build a finite element mesh, so now we have a 3D computational model of the animal’s anatomy.\n\nNext, we perform optical measurements — diffuse optical tomography — to estimate the optical properties of the tissues, like how much they scatter and absorb light. Once we have both the anatomical map and the optical map, we put them together. Now we have a very detailed, voxel-by-voxel model — a so-called prior model — of the animal’s body.\nWith that model, we can perform Monte Carlo simulations. This is similar to the photon simulation I showed you earlier. You put a light source at a certain location inside the model, and then you let thousands — or even millions — of photons propagate randomly in all directions. Each photon scatters, reflects, refracts, or gets absorbed, following the physical laws of light propagation in tissue. Eventually, some photons reach the surface, where they are detected.\n\nThis process tells us, for any assumed source position, what the light distribution on the surface would look like. We call that the forward problem — going from a known source to the expected surface measurement.\nThen, we flip the problem around. This is the inverse problem — we already know the surface light pattern (that’s what we measured), and we want to find the internal source distribution that could have produced it.\nSo we try different possible source locations — say, one in the middle of the body, one near the liver, one near the kidneys — and simulate each case. We compare the simulated surface pattern with the measured one. If they don’t match, we adjust the model, move the source slightly, and try again.\nAfter many iterations, when the simulated pattern matches the measured pattern well, we can say with confidence that the actual bioluminescent source is located in that region inside the animal.\n\nI remember one particular case — we found two bioluminescent spots, one near the upper right and one near the left kidney. When we later sacrificed the mouse and examined it, we indeed found two small tumor nodules exactly in those locations. It was like magic — a scientific magic trick!\nWe even published that work in Optics Express, showing this successful reconstruction. It was a very satisfying result.\n\nHowever, as with all research, the story isn’t all perfect. The reconstruction is extremely sensitive to errors in the model. If your optical properties are slightly off, or your anatomical registration isn’t perfect, the reconstructed source location can be wrong. That’s why, although it’s feasible, it’s not as robust or as straightforward as, say, X-ray CT.\nSo, to summarize — bioluminescence tomography is feasible, it works, but it’s still very much a research topic, not yet a clinical tool. It’s beautiful, it’s challenging, and it’s fun to work on. And along the way, we also contributed several new ideas to this field — such as combing tomography, helical scanning, interior tomography, and other concepts that pushed the boundaries of imaging research.\nSo yes — this was, and still is, a very enjoyable area of scientific discovery.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

The idea here is to combine optical imaging with X-ray imaging — a kind of hybrid approach.\n\nYou see, the limitation with traditional optical tomography is that it doesn’t give you good structural information. You can get molecular or functional data — yes, you can tell where the light comes from or which cells are active — but the anatomical detail is missing. On the other hand, X-ray CT gives you beautiful structure, very precise geometry, but not the molecular activity.\nSo, what if we could merge the two? What if we could combine the molecular sensitivity of optical imaging with the structural precision of X-ray imaging? That’s the motivation behind this work — we call it X-ray Optical Fusion.\n\nNow, traditional micro-CT — the standard kind — has a limitation. It’s great for bone, great for dense structures, but not so good for soft tissue. The contrast inside soft organs is very weak because the attenuation difference is small. So, you can’t see the fine internal structures clearly.\n\nThat’s why researchers have started exploring X-ray Phase-Contrast CT, or PCCT. This is a newer type of X-ray imaging that doesn’t just rely on attenuation — it actually detects the phase shift of the X-rays as they pass through tissue. This phase information is much more sensitive to subtle density changes, especially in soft tissue.\nSo, the hybrid idea is: combine Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) with X-ray Phase-Contrast CT. Together, they can provide both the functional molecular information from FMT and the high-resolution anatomical detail from PCCT.\n\nThere’s a paper on this — you can see it here — titled “FMT–PCCT: Hybrid Fluorescence Molecular Tomography and X-ray Phase-Contrast CT Imaging of Mouse Models.” It was published in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging in 2014 by researchers from the Helmholtz Center in Munich and collaborators in Germany. This kind of work really represents the next step — hybrid optical-X-ray imaging for small animal studies.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

In these experiments, the researchers scanned small animals — typically mice — sometimes for an entire day, to acquire very high-quality data.\n\nInstead of using conventional micro-CT, they used a grating-based phase-contrast tomography system. I actually mentioned this technique before, when we talked about my visit to Japan — the grating-based interferometric system. The setup uses a series of gratings — a source grating, a phase grating, and an analyzer grating — to measure very tiny changes in the X-ray phase as the beam passes through the sample.\n\nSo, what they did was essentially scan the animal — or tissue samples — using this grating-based X-ray phase-contrast CT. And they achieved beautiful soft-tissue visualization, something you simply can’t get from normal X-ray attenuation imaging.\n\nThese results, published by several European research groups, clearly demonstrated that grating-based phase-contrast tomography can reveal fine internal details — such as blood vessels, organ microstructures, and even tumor margins — without the need for any contrast agents.\nIt’s a big step forward for optical-X-ray fusion, because now the X-ray side of the hybrid system provides much richer anatomical detail to guide and constrain the optical reconstruction.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

We’re working on developing a tightly integrated system for in vivo optical and X-ray imaging — that means imaging live animals, not just tissue samples.\n\nIn the earlier work, what we call ex vivo imaging, the studies were done on isolated or preserved samples, which is great for testing physics, but not for observing biological dynamics. So, our goal is to move toward in vivo imaging, where we can study living processes in real time.\nOur approach is to build an orthogonal imaging chain — basically, an X-ray phase-contrast system aligned at a right angle to an optical imaging system. One part of the setup handles the phase-contrast X-ray imaging, while the other captures fluorescence or bioluminescence signals. By merging these two datasets, we can combine the strengths of both modalities — structural accuracy from X-rays and molecular sensitivity from optics.\n\nThe system includes components like a CCD camera, filter wheel, laser stage, isoflurane anesthesia line for live animal support, and a rotating gantry for tomographic data collection. The optical part uses mirrors, spectrometers, and digital micromirror devices for detecting and filtering the light.\nSo, what we’re working toward at RPI is a fully integrated hybrid imaging system — one that can acquire X-ray phase-contrast data and optical molecular data simultaneously.\n\nNow, this is still an active research topic. Achieving truly precise, stable 3D tomography in such a hybrid setup is not easy. There are still open questions — how to synchronize the modalities, how to register the datasets, how to compensate for motion, and how to achieve stable reconstructions.\nBut it’s an exciting direction. When you can successfully merge X-ray and optical data — one showing the anatomy, the other revealing the function — that’s when you get a truly powerful multimodal imaging system.\n\nSo, this is what we’re actively working on at RPI — a tighter, more integrated system that pushes the boundary of X-ray–optical fusion imaging.

But when you think about it, it makes perfect sense. X-rays penetrate deeply and travel straight, while optical imaging provides rich molecular and functional information. So, if we can somehow couple these two, we can get deep, high-resolution, molecularly sensitive images — the best of both worlds.\n\nSo this is what we mean by X-ray Optical Coupling — using X-rays to stimulate optical signals inside tissue, and then using those emitted optical photons to form an image.

This concept really reminds me of how fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins work. In fluorescence imaging, you have a fluorophore — say, a protein that absorbs one color of light and emits another. In bioluminescence, you have a chemical reaction that produces light on its own, like fireflies.\n\nNow, what researchers have done is introduce a new type of material, called a nanophosphor — it’s not a protein, not biological by nature, but rather an engineered material. Nanophosphors are nanoscale particles that have unique luminescent properties.\nHere’s how it works. When you shine an X-ray beam onto these nanophosphors, they emit visible or near-infrared light — in other words, they glow. You can even make different kinds of nanophosphors that emit different colors — green, red, near-infrared, far-infrared — depending on the specific material and dopant you use.\nSo, it’s very much in parallel with fluorescence imaging, except for one big difference: in fluorescence, you excite the molecules using laser light, which is itself light, and therefore it scatters heavily inside tissue. But in this case, the excitation comes from X-rays, which travel straight through the body. So, the spatial resolution is much better because X-rays are not affected by scattering the way light is.\n\nOne example of this can be seen in the study shown here — Photostimulated Near-Infrared Persistent Luminescence as a New Optical Readout from Chromium-Doped Lithium Gallium Oxide. This material, when irradiated by X-rays, stores the energy and then later emits near-infrared light when stimulated by low-energy light.\nThis concept — using X-ray-excitable nanophosphors — opens the door to a completely new kind of optical imaging. Instead of laser excitation, we use X-rays, and the resulting emitted light can be collected optically. That’s the core idea behind X-ray Optical Coupling.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

This is a very creative and forward-looking concept.\nThe essential idea is shown right here. You introduce X-ray-excitable nanophosphors into a small animal — usually a mouse. These nanophosphors can be functionalized — meaning you can coat their surface with polymers or peptides to make them target specific biomarkers. For example, if you want to target cancer cells, you attach a peptide that binds to receptors that are overexpressed in tumors.\n\nSo now, when these nanophosphors are injected into the body, they accumulate more densely in the tumor region than in normal tissue. Then, when you shine an X-ray beam, it goes straight through the body. Wherever it hits these nanophosphors, they emit optical light. And that light — the X-ray-induced luminescence — is detected by sensitive optical cameras around the animal.\n\nSo think about it: by scanning the X-ray beam and recording the emitted light, you can reconstruct the 3D distribution of these nanophosphors inside the body. That gives you a molecular image that is excited by X-rays and detected optically.\nThis is a very promising approach because it potentially makes X-rays a molecular imaging modality — something traditionally reserved for optical, nuclear, or MR imaging. You can now use X-rays not just for structure, but also to identify specific molecular targets.\n\nOf course, there are still challenges. When you collimate the X-ray beam — that means narrowing it to a small pencil beam — you face physical limits. Mechanical collimators can only get so thin, and even a narrow beam will spread out slightly due to scattering and beam divergence. So the current spatial resolution of XLCT is about 1 to 2 millimeters.\nNow, the question becomes: how can we improve that? How can we go from millimeter resolution down to, say, 100 microns — an order of magnitude better? That’s still an open research problem. It will require new hardware designs, smarter reconstruction algorithms, and probably better nanophosphor materials.\n\nBut the vision is clear — this approach could bridge the gap between anatomical imaging and molecular imaging, between optical precision and X-ray penetration. It’s one of those rare ideas that brings together two worlds — physics and biology — into a single, unified imaging platform.\nSo that’s the direction of X-ray Luminescence CT and X-ray Optical Coupling — still developing, but with tremendous potential for the future of biomedical imaging.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

This is one of the latest developments that builds upon everything we’ve discussed so far.\n\nIf you’re really interested, I recommend reading the original paper. But let me give you the idea in simple terms.\nIn XMLT, we treat the X-ray beam as a wave, not just as a stream of particles. That means we can actually use certain X-ray optical components — things that already exist on the market, like X-ray polycapillary lenses. These are special lenses that can focus X-rays, although not quite as tightly as optical lenses can focus visible light. Still, they can concentrate the X-ray beam to a small spot — around 100 microns, or even smaller in some setups.\nAnd because X-rays penetrate tissue so well, this focused beam can reach deep inside the object. So now, imagine we focus the X-ray into the tissue — we’re creating a tiny, well-defined excitation region.\n\nWhen we introduce nanophosphors into the sample — the same luminescent particles we talked about earlier — these particles light up only along the path of the focused X-ray beam. Everywhere else remains dark. That’s very important because it means the optical signal we collect corresponds precisely to the X-ray excitation path — no background interference from outside that region.\nSo the spatial resolution of this imaging method is determined entirely by the X-ray focal spot size, by how small that beam is. Think of it like drawing with a very fine pen instead of a broad brush.\n\nAnd geometrically, this is not a pencil beam or a fan beam like in standard CT. It’s more like a double-cone beam — a cone that converges to a focus point and then diverges again. So you get a cone of excitation in both directions.\nIn short, we perform tomography by collecting optical signals generated from these small, localized regions excited by the focused X-ray. We have published several papers on this topic, exploring the physics, the reconstruction algorithms, and the system design. It’s a fascinating direction for hybrid imaging research.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

You can imagine a setup like this: the X-ray beam enters an integrating sphere — that’s a spherical chamber lined with a highly reflective surface. It has just one small opening where the X-ray beam enters and where the emitted photons exit.\nHere’s how it works. The X-ray beam excites the nanophosphors in a very small region. Those nanophosphors emit optical photons — visible or near-infrared light. The integrating sphere reflects these photons multiple times — bouncing them around the inner wall — so that, eventually, almost every photon finds its way to the detector, usually a PMT, or photomultiplier tube. This design allows us to collect nearly all the emitted light with minimal loss.\nThat’s how we can do small-animal imaging efficiently.\n\nNow, if we scale up this concept, we can also envision doing human imaging, especially for the brain. The human cerebral cortex has about six layers, and together they’re roughly six millimeters thick. The interesting part — the one related to higher-level brain function and intelligence — lies not just on the surface, but deeper in those inner cortical layers.\nSo, how can we noninvasively reach those deeper layers? Well, one potential path is to use nanophosphors that can cross the blood–brain barrier and label specific neural structures. Then, we use a micro-focused X-ray beam to excite those particles deep inside the brain.\n\nHere’s where it gets really exciting — and, yes, a little bit like science fiction. When neurons fire, they produce action potentials — tiny electrical currents. These currents can interact with the nanophosphors, changing their quantum emission properties — for example, the color or intensity of the light they emit.\nSo in theory, by monitoring how the emitted light changes, we could infer neural activity — we could literally watch the brain think. Imagine detecting color changes corresponding to neural firing patterns!\n\nNow, I’m not saying we’re there yet — far from it. This is still in the conceptual stage. But it’s a very cool direction to pursue — combining X-ray excitation, optical emission, and nanophosphor sensing to probe deep brain function noninvasively. It’s futuristic, but scientifically grounded.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

Depending on the wavelength of light you use, you can either activate or inhibit neural activity.\n\nFor example, blue light — around 470 nanometers — can open certain channels, allowing positively charged ions like sodium or calcium to enter the neuron, thereby triggering an electrical signal. On the other hand, yellow or red light — around 570 or 590 nanometers — can open other types of channels that inhibit activity, stopping the neuron from firing.\nSo, by simply changing the color of light, you can make a neuron fire or stop firing. It’s almost like using a remote control for the brain!\n\nResearchers have used this technique to study complex neurological conditions — things like depression, Parkinson’s disease, and addiction — where precise control of neural circuits is essential. You can shine light on specific regions of the brain and observe behavioral changes in animals — say, a mouse moving left when you use one color, or right when you use another.\n\nHowever, there’s a limitation. Optical light doesn’t penetrate deeply — it only reaches about one millimeter into tissue. If you want to reach deeper layers, you have to insert an optical fiber directly into the brain. And, of course, that’s invasive — it causes tissue damage, and you can’t easily use it for large-scale or long-term experiments.\nSo, while optogenetics is an incredibly powerful tool, its reach is still limited by the physics of light scattering.", "total_slides_in_lecture": 50}

We know that X-rays can penetrate deeply into tissue, and we also know that nanophosphors can convert X-rays into visible light. So, what if we could use X-rays as a remote light source to activate optogenetic proteins deep inside the brain?\n\nHere’s how it would work. We inject nanophosphors small enough to pass through the blood–brain barrier — so they can distribute evenly within the brain tissue. Then, we shine a focused X-ray beam into a specific region. The nanophosphors there absorb the X-rays and emit light locally — right where the neurons are.\n\nThat emitted light can then activate the optogenetic channels — just like in traditional optogenetics, but now without inserting any optical fibers. Everything is done noninvasively.\nIn our paper, we discussed this as a possible future imaging and neurostimulation technique. One of my undergraduate students — who is now working full-time on this — helped develop the idea. We’re currently characterizing different nanophosphor materials, testing their emission spectra, decay times, and compatibility with biological tissue.\n\nThis concept could open the door to deep-brain stimulation without surgery, combining the precision of optogenetics with the penetration of X-rays.
